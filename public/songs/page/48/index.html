<p>Picture this: your five-year-old is brushing their teeth before bed and suddenly starts singing, &ldquo;My soul finds rest in God alone, my salvation comes from Him.&rdquo; What began as a simple song during family worship time has become Scripture hidden deep in their heart, ready to comfort and guide them through life&rsquo;s journey.</p>
<h2 id="the-biblical-foundation-for-childrens-faith-songs">The Biblical Foundation for Children&rsquo;s Faith Songs</h2>
<p>When we explore the role of music in children&rsquo;s faith development, we discover that Scripture itself provides our roadmap. <strong>Deuteronomy 6:6-7</strong> instructs us to keep God&rsquo;s words &ldquo;on your hearts&rdquo; and &ldquo;teach them diligently to your children, talking of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise.&rdquo; Faith songs create natural opportunities for this continuous teaching.</p>
