<p>Have you ever watched a three-year-old suddenly burst into song about something they learned just minutes ago? This isn&rsquo;t just adorable—it&rsquo;s how God designed young brains to learn and remember His truth.

<h2 id="biblical-foundation-why-god-calls-us-to-sing-his-word">Biblical Foundation: Why God Calls Us to Sing His Word</h2>
<p>Scripture consistently points to music as God&rsquo;s chosen method for teaching and remembering His truth. <strong>Colossians 3:16</strong> instructs us to &ldquo;let the message of Christ dwell among you richly as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom through psalms, hymns, and songs from the Spirit.&rdquo; This isn&rsquo;t merely a suggestion—it&rsquo;s divine design for how families should approach spiritual formation.</p>
