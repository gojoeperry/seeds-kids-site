<p>Picture this: your six-year-old is humming a tune while playing with blocks, but instead of a random jingle, they&rsquo;re singing &ldquo;For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son&hellip;&rdquo; Your intentional Christian kids playlist has transformed ordinary moments into worship experiences where God&rsquo;s Word naturally flows from their heart.</p>

<p>When we examine Scripture, we discover that God designed music as a powerful vehicle for teaching and remembering His truth. Colossians 3:16 instructs us to &ldquo;let the message of Christ dwell among you richly as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom through psalms, hymns, and songs from the Spirit, singing to God with gratitude in your hearts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Picture this: your three-year-old spontaneously starts singing &ldquo;Jesus loves me&rdquo; while playing with blocks, or your four-year-old comforts a crying friend by humming a worship song they learned at home.
