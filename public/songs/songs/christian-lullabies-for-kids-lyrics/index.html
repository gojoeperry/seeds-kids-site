<p>&ldquo;When you lie down, you will not be afraid; when you lie down, your sleep will be sweet.&rdquo; - Proverbs 3:24</p>

<li>&ldquo;Create a gentle &ldquo;Jesus Loves Me&rdquo; bedtime version by singing it at half-speed with soft, swaying motions&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Use &ldquo;God&rsquo;s Love Is Like a Blanket&rdquo; with hand motions, wrapping arms around yourself while singing&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Try &ldquo;Guardian Angels&rdquo; with peaceful finger actions: making wings, pointing to heaven, and forming a heart shape&rdquo;
These songs work beautifully for both bedtime at home and quiet time at church nurseries.</li>

<p>Dear God, thank you for watching over us day and night. Help us rest peacefully knowing you are near. Amen.</p>
