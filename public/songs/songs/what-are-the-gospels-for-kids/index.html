<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>When teaching children about the Bible, one of the most important questions to address is &ldquo;what are the gospels for kids?&rdquo; The Gospels are the first four books of the New Testament - Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John - that tell the amazing story of Jesus&rsquo; life, teachings, and love for us. Understanding what are the gospels for kids helps build a strong foundation for their faith journey. These special books are like four different friends telling us about Jesus from their own perspective, making His story come alive in unique and meaningful ways. The Gospels help children understand who Jesus is, what He did while on earth, and how much He loves them. By exploring these books, kids can develop a personal relationship with Jesus and learn valuable lessons about God&rsquo;s amazing plan.</p>
<h3 id="scripture">Scripture</h3>
<p>&ldquo;For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.&rdquo; - John 3:16</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jesus said, &lsquo;Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.&rsquo;&rdquo; - Matthew 19:14</p>
<h2 id="worship-ideas">Worship Ideas</h2>
<ol>
<li>&ldquo;Gospel Story Charades&rdquo;: Act out different stories from the Gospels like Jesus calming the storm or feeding the 5,000</li>
<li>&ldquo;Four Gospel Corner Game&rdquo;: Designate room corners as Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, then have kids move to the correct corner when you read a story from that Gospel</li>
<li>&ldquo;Jesus Loves Me&rdquo; with added verses about Gospel stories and matching hand motions</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="devotional-thought">Devotional Thought</h3>
<p>Jesus wanted His story to be shared with everyone, including children! That&rsquo;s why He gave us four special books to help us know Him better. Just like having different friends tell us about a fun day at the park, each Gospel writer tells us about Jesus in their own special way. When we read the Gospels, we learn that Jesus is our friend who loves us very much.</p>
<p>Dear Jesus, thank you for giving us the Gospels so we can learn about your life and love. Help us understand your stories and share them with others. Amen.</p>
<h3 id="faqs">FAQs</h3>
<p><strong>What age should children start learning about the Gospels?</strong>
Children can start learning about the Gospels as early as preschool through simple stories and pictures. Around ages 6-8, they can begin understanding more details about the different Gospel accounts.</p>
<p><strong>How can I make the Gospels interesting for my kids?</strong>
Make Gospel stories come alive through interactive activities like role-playing, drawing, or using children&rsquo;s Bible storybooks with colorful illustrations. Connect the stories to everyday situations your children can understand.</p>
<p><strong>Where can I find good resources to teach kids about the Gospels?</strong>
Look for age-appropriate children&rsquo;s Bibles, Christian bookstores&rsquo; children&rsquo;s sections, and online resources from reputable Christian education websites. Your local church&rsquo;s children&rsquo;s ministry may also have recommended materials and curriculum.</p>
