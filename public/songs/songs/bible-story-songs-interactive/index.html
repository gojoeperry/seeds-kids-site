<h3 id="scripture">Scripture</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom, singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, with thankfulness in your hearts to God.&rdquo; - Colossians 3:16</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make a joyful noise to the Lord, all the earth! Serve the Lord with gladness! Come into his presence with singing!&rdquo; - Psalm 100:1-2</p>
<h2 id="worship-ideas">Worship Ideas</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Noah&rsquo;s Ark Animal Parade&rdquo; - Children act out different animals while singing about Noah&rsquo;s faithfulness. Include stomping like elephants, hopping like kangaroos, and roaring like lions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;David and Goliath Victory Dance&rdquo; - Kids march in place while singing about David&rsquo;s bravery, then spin in celebration when Goliath falls. Use simple percussion instruments for added engagement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Jesus Loves the Little Children&rdquo; with sign language - Teach basic signs while singing this classic, helping children connect physical movement with spiritual truth.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="devotional-thought">Devotional Thought</h3>
<p>Just as David praised God with dancing and singing, we can worship God with our whole bodies and voices. When we sing and move to bible story songs, we&rsquo;re showing God how much we love Him. He gave us music and movement as special gifts to express our joy in Him.</p>
<p>Dear God, thank you for giving us songs to sing and ways to move as we worship You. Help us remember Your stories and share Your love with others through our joyful praise. Amen.</p>
