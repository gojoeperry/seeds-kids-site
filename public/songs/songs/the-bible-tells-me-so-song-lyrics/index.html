<h2 id="the-bible-tells-me-so-song-lyrics-teaching-children-gods-love">The Bible Tells Me So Song Lyrics: Teaching Children God&rsquo;s Love</h2>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Teaching children about God&rsquo;s love through music is one of the most powerful ways to nurture their faith. &ldquo;The Bible tells me so song lyrics&rdquo; have been helping young hearts understand God&rsquo;s truth for generations. When children learn these simple yet profound words, they begin to grasp the fundamental message that Jesus loves them unconditionally. The melody and movements make spiritual truths memorable, while the repetitive nature of &ldquo;The Bible tells me so song lyrics&rdquo; helps reinforce these essential messages of faith. For parents and teachers, these songs provide an engaging way to introduce biblical concepts during worship time, bedtime routines, or Sunday school activities.</p>
<h3 id="scripture">Scripture</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.&rdquo; - Matthew 19:14</p>
