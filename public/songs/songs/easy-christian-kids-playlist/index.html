<h3 id="scripture">Scripture</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise.&rdquo; - Psalm 98:4</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let everything that has breath praise the Lord. Praise the Lord!&rdquo; - Psalm 150:6</p>
<h2 id="worship-ideas">Worship Ideas</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Jesus Loves Me&rdquo; with Sign Language
Create simple hand motions for key phrases and teach them one at a time. Kids love using their hands to express worship!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Every Move I Make&rdquo; Dance Party
Encourage kids to jump, spin, and dance while singing about God&rsquo;s love. Add colorful streamers or ribbons for extra fun.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;This Little Light of Mine&rdquo; Action Song
Use finger motions and body movements to act out hiding the light, letting it shine, and not letting Satan blow it out.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="devotional-thought">Devotional Thought</h3>
<p>God loves to hear children worship! Just like parents delight in hearing their children sing, our Heavenly Father celebrates when we praise Him with joy and enthusiasm. Jesus welcomed children and valued their faith - that&rsquo;s why making worship fun and accessible is so important.</p>
<p>Dear God, thank you for giving us music to praise you. Help us worship you with happy hearts and teach others about your love. Amen.</p>
