<p>God loves to hear children&rsquo;s voices raised in praise! Just as parents delight in hearing their children sing, our Heavenly Father cherishes the worship of His little ones. Jesus welcomed children, saying the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these (Matthew 19:14). When we help children worship joyfully, we&rsquo;re following Jesus&rsquo;s example.</p>
<p>Prayer: &ldquo;Dear God, thank you for giving us songs to sing and ways to praise you. Help us make joyful noise together! Amen.&rdquo;</p>
