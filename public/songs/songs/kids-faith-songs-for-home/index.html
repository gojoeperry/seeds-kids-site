<h3 id="devotional-thought">Devotional Thought</h3>
<p>God loves to hear children worship! Just like parents treasure hearing their little ones sing, our Heavenly Father delights in the praise of His children. When we sing about God&rsquo;s love, we&rsquo;re reminding ourselves of how special we are to Him. Jesus said to let the little children come to Him, and worship through song is a beautiful way to draw near to God.</p>
<p>Dear God, thank you for giving us voices to sing and hearts to love You. Help us make joyful music for You every day. Amen.</p>

<h3 id="what-age-should-children-start-learning-worship-songs">What age should children start learning worship songs?</h3>
<p>Children can start learning worship songs from infancy! Even babies benefit from hearing spiritual music, and toddlers naturally begin to engage with simple melodies and motions. As children grow, they can gradually learn more complex songs and deeper meanings.</p>
<h3 id="how-can-i-make-worship-time-more-engaging-at-home">How can I make worship time more engaging at home?</h3>
<p>Make it fun and interactive! Use instruments (even homemade ones), add motions, create props, or draw pictures while singing. Keep sessions short (10-15 minutes), and let children take turns leading. Consistency matters more than length.</p>
