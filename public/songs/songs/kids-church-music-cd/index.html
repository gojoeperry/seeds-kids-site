Whether used in Sunday school, during family devotion time, or for car ride singalongs, these musical collections help plant seeds of faith that can grow throughout a child&rsquo;s spiritual journey.

<h3 id="scripture">Scripture</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise.&rdquo; - Psalm 98:4</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let everything that has breath praise the Lord. Praise the Lord!&rdquo; - Psalm 150:6</p>
<h2 id="worship-ideas">Worship Ideas</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Follow the Leader Praise&rdquo;: Have children take turns being the worship leader while playing songs from the CD. They can create simple motions for others to follow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Bible Story Soundtrack&rdquo;: Use upbeat worship songs as background music while acting out Bible stories. Kids can march around Jericho or dance like David.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Praise Freeze Dance&rdquo;: Play high-energy worship songs and have children dance, then freeze in a praise pose when the music pauses.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="devotional-thought">Devotional Thought</h3>
<p>Just as birds sing their special songs each morning, God gave us voices to sing His praises too. When we worship with music, we&rsquo;re joining a beautiful chorus that brings joy to God&rsquo;s heart. He loves to hear children&rsquo;s voices lifted in praise, no matter if they&rsquo;re perfectly in tune or just enthusiastically making a joyful noise.</p>
<p>Prayer: &ldquo;Dear God, thank you for giving us music to praise You. Help us remember that our worship makes You smile. Amen.&rdquo;</p>
