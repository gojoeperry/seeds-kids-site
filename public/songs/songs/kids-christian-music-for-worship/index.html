<h3 id="devotional-thought">Devotional Thought</h3>
<p>Just as birds sing their beautiful songs to start each morning, God loves to hear our voices lifted in praise. When we worship, we&rsquo;re telling God how much we love Him and thanking Him for His goodness. Jesus said that God especially loves to hear children&rsquo;s praise because it comes from pure, believing hearts.</p>
<p>Dear God, thank you for giving us music to praise you. Help us sing with joy and remember how much you love us. Amen.</p>

<h3 id="what-age-should-children-start-participating-in-worship-music">What age should children start participating in worship music?</h3>

<p>Create a dedicated worship time with instruments (even homemade ones), dance moves, and visual aids. Make it interactive by letting kids choose songs, lead motions, or play simple instruments. Consistency and enthusiasm are key to making it meaningful.</p>
