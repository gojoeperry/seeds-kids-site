For parents and teachers looking to nurture their children&rsquo;s faith, interactive Scripture songs provide an invaluable tool that speaks to kids&rsquo; natural love of music and movement while building a strong biblical foundation.</p>
<h3 id="scripture">Scripture</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom, singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, with thankfulness in your hearts to God.&rdquo; - Colossians 3:16</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have hidden your word in my heart that I might not sin against you.&rdquo; - Psalm 119:11</p>
<h2 id="worship-ideas">Worship Ideas</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Bible Verse Freeze Dance&rdquo;: Play upbeat Scripture songs and have kids dance. When the music stops, they freeze and shout out the verse together.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Memory Verse Motions&rdquo;: Create simple hand gestures for key words in the verse. For example, point up for &ldquo;God,&rdquo; cross arms over heart for &ldquo;love,&rdquo; and spread arms wide for &ldquo;world.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Scripture Song Echo&rdquo;: Leader sings one line of a Bible verse song, and children echo it back, getting progressively softer until whispering.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="devotional-thought">Devotional Thought</h3>
<p>Just as God uses many different ways to speak to us, we can use many different ways to learn His Word. When we sing Scripture, we&rsquo;re praising God while hiding His truth in our hearts. Jesus loves to hear children&rsquo;s voices lifted in song, and He delights when we learn about Him in fun, creative ways.</p>
<p>Dear God, thank you for giving us music to help us learn your Word. Help us to remember your truth as we sing and dance for you. Amen.</p>
