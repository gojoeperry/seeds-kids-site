<p>&ldquo;Make a joyful noise to the Lord, all the earth! Serve the Lord with gladness! Come into his presence with singing!&rdquo; - Psalm 100:1-2</p>

<ol>
<li>&ldquo;The B-I-B-L-E&rdquo; with alphabet motions: Have kids spell out each letter with their bodies</li>
<li>&ldquo;Jesus Loves Me&rdquo; with heart hands: Create heart shapes during the chorus and point to self</li>
<li>&ldquo;This Little Light of Mine&rdquo;: Use finger motions for the light and hiding under a bushel</li>
</ol>
<p>Make these songs interactive by adding simple percussion instruments like tambourines or creating a follow-the-leader style dance circle.</p>

<p>Dear Jesus, thank you for giving us music to praise you. Help us use our voices to share your love with others. Amen.</p>
