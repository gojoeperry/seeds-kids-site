<p>&ldquo;This Little Light of Mine&rdquo; - Kids can hold up pointer fingers as &ldquo;lights&rdquo; and perform circular motions while singing about letting their light shine.</p>

<p>Prayer: &ldquo;Dear Jesus, thank you for giving us songs and movements to praise you. Help us to worship you with joy in our hearts. Amen.&rdquo;</p>
