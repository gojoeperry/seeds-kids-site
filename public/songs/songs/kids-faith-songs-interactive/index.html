<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

By incorporating kids faith songs interactive elements into home devotions or Sunday school, parents and teachers can make spiritual education both fun and impactful. These dynamic worship experiences help children see that following Jesus is a joyful adventure they can participate in every day.</p>

<p>Just as God gave us voices to sing and bodies to move, He wants us to use everything we have to praise Him. When we worship with our whole selves – singing, dancing, and celebrating – we show God how much we love Him. Jesus welcomes children&rsquo;s praise and delights in our joyful expressions of faith.</p>
<p>Prayer: &ldquo;Dear Jesus, thank you for giving us music and movement to praise you. Help us worship you with happy hearts. Amen.&rdquo;</p>
