<p>&ldquo;Let everything that has breath praise the Lord. Praise the Lord!&rdquo; (Psalm 150:6)
&ldquo;Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise.&rdquo; (Psalm 98:4)</p>
<h2 id="worship-ideas">Worship Ideas</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Jesus Loves Me&rdquo; with Sign Language

</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;This Little Light of Mine&rdquo; Action Song
Kids hold up their &ldquo;light&rdquo; (pointer finger) and follow actions like hiding it under a bush (other hand), letting it shine all around (make circles), and not letting Satan blow it out (shake finger &ldquo;no&rdquo;).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;God&rsquo;s Love is So Big&rdquo; with Stretching
Have children stretch their arms wide, high, and low to show how big, tall, and deep God&rsquo;s love is.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="devotional-thought">Devotional Thought</h3>
<p>God loves to hear children worship! Just like parents love hearing their children sing and laugh, our Heavenly Father delights in the praise of His little ones. When we worship, we&rsquo;re telling God how much we love Him and thank Him for all He&rsquo;s done. Every song we sing is like giving God a big hug!</p>
<p>Dear God, thank you for music and for letting us praise you with songs. Help us to worship you with all our hearts. Amen.</p>

<p><strong>Q: How can I make worship time more engaging for my kids?</strong>
A: Incorporate movement, use visual aids like puppets or pictures, and let children take turns leading. Make it interactive by adding instruments like tambourines or shakers, and praise their participation enthusiastically.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Where can I find free children&rsquo;s worship songs legally?</strong>
A: Many Christian websites offer free downloadable worship songs.
