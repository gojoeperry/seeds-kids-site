<p>Just as Jesus welcomed little children to come to Him, He delights in hearing young voices sing His praises. When we teach our little ones to worship through song, we&rsquo;re helping them express their love for God in their own special way. Every smile, every dance move, and every imperfect note is precious to Him.</p>
<p>Prayer: &ldquo;Dear Jesus, thank you for giving us songs to praise you. Help us to share your love through music. Amen.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="faqs">FAQs</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What age should children start learning Bible songs?
Children can start learning Bible songs as early as infancy. Even babies benefit from hearing spiritual music, and toddlers naturally begin to engage with simple melodies and movements around age 2-3.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can I make Bible songs more engaging for preschoolers?
Incorporate hand motions, use visual aids like puppets or pictures, and keep sessions short (5-10 minutes). Repetition is key, and don&rsquo;t be afraid to be silly and energetic while leading the songs.</p>
