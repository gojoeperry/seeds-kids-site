<h3 id="devotional-thought">Devotional Thought</h3>
<p>Just as birds sing their beautiful songs each morning, God created us to praise Him with joy and enthusiasm. When we sing praise songs, we&rsquo;re telling God how much we love Him and thanking Him for all He&rsquo;s done. Jesus loves to hear children&rsquo;s voices lifted in worship - that&rsquo;s why He said to let the little children come to Him!</p>
<p>Dear God, thank you for giving us voices to sing and hearts to love You. Help us praise You with joy every day. Amen.</p>
