<p>Just as birds sing their beautiful songs each morning, God wants us to sing and make music for Him too! When we sing about Jesus, it makes His heart happy, and it helps us remember how much He loves us. Even if we don&rsquo;t know all the words or can&rsquo;t carry a perfect tune, God loves to hear our voices lifted in praise.</p>
<p>Dear God, thank you for giving us songs to sing. Help us to praise you with happy hearts. Amen.</p>
