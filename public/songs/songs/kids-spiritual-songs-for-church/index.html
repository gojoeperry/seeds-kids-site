<h3 id="devotional-thought">Devotional Thought</h3>
<p>Just as birds sing their beautiful songs to express joy, God gave us voices to sing His praises. When we sing worship songs, we&rsquo;re telling God how much we love Him and thanking Him for all He&rsquo;s done. Jesus loves to hear children&rsquo;s voices lifted in praise - remember how He welcomed the little children to come to Him? Every time we sing, we&rsquo;re sharing our hearts with God and growing closer to Him.</p>
<p>Dear God, thank you for giving us music and songs to praise You. Help us use our voices to share Your love with others. Amen.</p>
