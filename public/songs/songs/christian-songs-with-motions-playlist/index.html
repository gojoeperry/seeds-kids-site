<h3 id="scripture">Scripture</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Let them praise his name with dancing and make music to him with timbrel and harp.&rdquo; - Psalm 149:3</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise.&rdquo; - Psalm 98:4</p>
<h2 id="worship-ideas">Worship Ideas</h2>
<ol>
<li>&ldquo;Every Move I Make&rdquo; - Have kids jump during &ldquo;na na na&rdquo; and wave arms for &ldquo;waves of mercy&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;This Little Light of Mine&rdquo; - Hold up pointer finger as a candle, shine it everywhere, and hide it under hands for &ldquo;won&rsquo;t let Satan blow it out&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Jesus Loves Me&rdquo; - Cross arms over chest for &ldquo;loves,&rdquo; point up for &ldquo;Jesus,&rdquo; and point to self for &ldquo;me&rdquo;</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="devotional-thought">Devotional Thought</h3>
<p>Just as we use our whole bodies to show excitement about our favorite things, we can use our entire selves to show God how much we love Him. When we jump, dance, and move in worship, we&rsquo;re telling Jesus that He makes us so happy we can&rsquo;t stay still! Remember, God gave us our bodies as instruments of praise.</p>
<p>Prayer: Dear Jesus, thank you for giving us songs to sing and ways to move as we worship You. Help us use our whole selves to show You how much we love You. Amen.</p>
