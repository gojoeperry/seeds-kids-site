<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>The Bible is filled with beautiful songs that help us worship God! When we explore the list of songs in the Bible, we discover that God&rsquo;s people have been singing praises for thousands of years. From Moses&rsquo; victory song to Mary&rsquo;s song of joy about baby Jesus, these biblical songs teach children how to express their love for God through music. Understanding the list of songs in the Bible helps kids connect with worship in a meaningful way, showing them that praising God can be both fun and deeply spiritual. These ancient songs demonstrate that worship has always been an important part of God&rsquo;s family, and they provide wonderful examples for teaching children how to praise God with their whole hearts.</p>
<h3 id="scripture">Scripture</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Sing to the Lord a new song; sing to the Lord, all the earth!&rdquo; (Psalm 96:1)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let everything that has breath praise the Lord! Praise the Lord!&rdquo; (Psalm 150:6)</p>
<h2 id="worship-ideas">Worship Ideas</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;David&rsquo;s Dance Party&rdquo;: Have children dance and twirl with ribbons while singing psalms, just like King David did when he brought the Ark to Jerusalem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Moses and Miriam&rsquo;s Praise Parade&rdquo;: Create simple tambourines using paper plates and bells, then march around singing &ldquo;The Lord is my strength and my song&rdquo; (Exodus 15:2).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Creation Chorus&rdquo;: Take turns having kids make animal sounds while singing about how all creation praises God.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="devotional-thought">Devotional Thought</h3>
<p>Just like a birthday card expresses love to someone special, songs in the Bible are like love letters to God. When we sing these songs, we&rsquo;re joining with billions of people throughout history who have praised God. Jesus loves to hear children&rsquo;s voices lifted in praise! Even when we don&rsquo;t feel like singing, we can remember that God delights in our worship.</p>
<p>Prayer: &ldquo;Dear God, thank you for giving us songs to sing. Help us praise you with joy, just like your people did in the Bible. Amen.&rdquo;</p>
