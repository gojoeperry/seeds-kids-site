<h3 id="scripture">Scripture</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Let everything that has breath praise the Lord. Praise the Lord!&rdquo; - Psalm 150:6</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise.&rdquo; - Psalm 98:4</p>
<h2 id="worship-ideas">Worship Ideas</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Every Move I Make&rdquo; - Have children follow simple hand motions while singing about God&rsquo;s presence in their lives. Add jumping and spinning during the chorus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;This Little Light of Mine&rdquo; - Give each child a battery-operated tea light to hold up during the song. Have them &ldquo;shine&rdquo; their light in different directions as they sing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Jesus Loves Me&rdquo; - Create a simple sign language routine to accompany this classic song, helping children connect physical movement with meaningful lyrics.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="devotional-thought">Devotional Thought</h3>
<p>Just as birds sing their beautiful songs to express joy, God gave us voices to praise Him. When we worship, we&rsquo;re telling God how much we love Him and thanking Him for His goodness. Jesus loves to hear children&rsquo;s voices lifted in praise!</p>
<p>Prayer: &ldquo;Dear Jesus, thank you for giving us music to praise you. Help us to sing with joy and remember how much you love us. Amen.&rdquo;</p>
