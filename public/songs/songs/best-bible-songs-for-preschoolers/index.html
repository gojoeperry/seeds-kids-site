<p>Just as birds sing their beautiful songs to express joy, God gave us voices to sing His praises. When we sing about Jesus, we&rsquo;re telling Him how much we love Him, just like when we tell our parents or friends we love them. God loves to hear children&rsquo;s voices lifted in praise!</p>
<p>Dear God, thank you for giving us songs to sing about your love. Help us make joyful music for you every day. Amen.</p>
