<p>Just as birds sing their beautiful songs to express joy, God gave us voices to sing His praises. When we worship through music, we&rsquo;re sharing our love for Him in a special way that makes both our hearts and His happy. Remember that God loves to hear your voice, whether you&rsquo;re singing quietly in your room or loudly with friends at church.</p>
<p>Dear God, thank you for the gift of music and for letting us praise you through songs. Help us to worship you with joy in our hearts. Amen.</p>
