<p>God&rsquo;s love is like a beautiful song that fills our hearts with joy. When we sing praise songs, we&rsquo;re telling God how much we love Him and thanking Him for His amazing love for us. Jesus wants us to come to Him with happy hearts and lifted voices, just like children running to their parents with excitement.</p>
<p>Prayer: &ldquo;Dear Jesus, thank you for giving us music to praise you. Help us to sing with joy and share your love with others. Amen.&rdquo;</p>
