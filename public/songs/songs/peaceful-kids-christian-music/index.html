<h3 id="scripture">Scripture</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom, singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, with thankfulness in your hearts to God.&rdquo; - Colossians 3:16</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be still, and know that I am God.&rdquo; - Psalm 46:10</p>

<li>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s Got the Whole World&rdquo; Hand Motions: Guide children through gentle hand movements representing God&rsquo;s care for creation, using slower tempo for calming effect</li>

God loves to hear children worship Him, whether it&rsquo;s through soft whispers or gentle songs.</p>
<p>Dear Jesus, thank you for giving us peaceful music to help us feel close to you. Help us remember you&rsquo;re always near when we sing. Amen.</p>
