<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Many parents wondering &ldquo;is One Voice Children&rsquo;s Choir Mormon?&rdquo; are seeking to understand this popular youth choir&rsquo;s background as they explore worship music options for their children. While One Voice Children&rsquo;s Choir originated in Utah and has some Mormon members, it&rsquo;s actually a non-denominational choir open to children of all faiths. The choir&rsquo;s focus is on inspiring young people through uplifting music that celebrates faith, hope, and love.</p>
<p>Understanding a choir&rsquo;s background helps parents make informed choices about their children&rsquo;s musical and spiritual development. The question &ldquo;is One Voice Children&rsquo;s Choir Mormon?&rdquo; matters because it opens up important conversations about inclusive worship, musical excellence, and how different faith traditions can come together through song to praise God.</p>
<h3 id="scripture">Scripture</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise.&rdquo; - Psalm 98:4</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let everything that has breath praise the Lord. Praise the Lord!&rdquo; - Psalm 150:6</p>
<h2 id="worship-ideas">Worship Ideas</h2>
<p>Create your own inclusive children&rsquo;s choir experience with these activities:</p>
<ol>
<li>&ldquo;Echo Praise&rdquo; - Leader sings a line of praise, children echo it back. Include simple hand motions.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Rainbow of Voices&rdquo; - Divide kids into groups, each singing a different part of &ldquo;Jesus Loves Me&rdquo; to create harmony.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Prayer in Song&rdquo; - Teach children to turn their prayers into simple melodies, encouraging personal worship expression.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="devotional-thought">Devotional Thought</h3>
<p>Just as many voices come together in a choir to create beautiful music, God delights in hearing all His children worship Him in their own unique ways. Whether we sing in a grand choir or quietly in our rooms, God treasures every voice raised in praise.</p>
<p>Dear God, thank you for giving us voices to sing Your praise. Help us remember that when we join together in worship, our differences make the music even more beautiful. Amen.</p>
