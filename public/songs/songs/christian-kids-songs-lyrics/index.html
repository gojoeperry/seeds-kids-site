<p>Just as God&rsquo;s love never ends, the songs we sing about Him can stay in our hearts forever. When we sing worship songs, we&rsquo;re telling God how much we love Him, just like when we tell our parents or friends we love them. Jesus loves to hear children&rsquo;s voices lifted in praise!</p>
<p>Prayer: &ldquo;Dear Jesus, thank you for giving us music to praise you. Help us remember these special songs and feel your love when we sing them. Amen.&rdquo;</p>
