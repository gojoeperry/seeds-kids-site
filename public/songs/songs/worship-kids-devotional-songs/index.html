<p>God loves to hear children worship! Just like parents treasure hearing their children say &ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; our Heavenly Father delights in our praise. When we sing worship songs, we&rsquo;re telling God how much we love Him and thanking Him for His goodness. Every voice is special to God - He doesn&rsquo;t care if we sing perfectly, He just wants our hearts to be full of joy!</p>
<p>Dear God, thank you for giving us songs to praise you. Help us remember that you love hearing our voices lifted in worship. Amen.</p>
