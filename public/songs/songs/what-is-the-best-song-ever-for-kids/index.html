<h3 id="devotional-thought">Devotional Thought</h3>
<p>Just as Jesus welcomed children with open arms, He delights in hearing their voices raised in song. When we worship, we&rsquo;re telling Jesus how much we love Him, and He loves hearing every note - whether it&rsquo;s perfectly in tune or wonderfully wild! Remember, worship isn&rsquo;t about being the best singer; it&rsquo;s about giving our best love to Jesus.</p>
<p>Prayer: &ldquo;Dear Jesus, thank you for loving to hear us sing. Help us worship you with all our heart, whether we&rsquo;re singing, dancing, or just being quiet with you. Amen.&rdquo;</p>
