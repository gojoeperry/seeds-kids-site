<p>Just as Jesus welcomed children with open arms, He welcomes our worship today. Every voice matters to God, especially the pure, honest praise of children. When we sing to God, we&rsquo;re telling Him how much we love Him and thank Him for His care. He delights in our songs, no matter how simple they may be.</p>
<p>Prayer: &ldquo;Dear Jesus, thank you for loving children and listening to our songs. Help us to praise you with joy in our hearts. Amen.&rdquo;</p>
