<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Listener Kids: This is the day that the Lord has made lyrics&rdquo; is a joyful celebration of God&rsquo;s daily gifts to us, perfectly crafted for young worship experiences. This beloved children&rsquo;s worship song helps little ones understand that each day is a special present from God, worthy of our praise and thanksgiving. When children learn &ldquo;Listener Kids: This is the day that the Lord has made lyrics,&rdquo; they develop a foundation of gratitude and learn to recognize God&rsquo;s handiwork in their daily lives. The simple, repetitive nature of the song makes it perfect for toddlers through elementary-aged children, helping them internalize the truth that God is the creator of every new day and every good gift.</p>
<h3 id="scripture">Scripture</h3>
<p>&ldquo;This is the day that the Lord has made; let us rejoice and be glad in it.&rdquo; - Psalm 118:24</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights.&rdquo; - James 1:17</p>

<p>Dear God, thank you for giving us this beautiful day. Help us to see your love in everything around us. Amen.</p>
