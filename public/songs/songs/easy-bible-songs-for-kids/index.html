<p>Just as God fills the birds with songs to sing, He gives us music to praise Him too! When we sing about Jesus, we&rsquo;re telling Him how much we love Him and reminding ourselves of His wonderful promises. Every time we lift our voices in song, we join with angels in heaven who are always praising God.</p>
<p>Prayer: &ldquo;Dear Jesus, thank you for giving us music to praise you. Help us to sing with joy and remember that you love hearing our songs. Amen.&rdquo;</p>
