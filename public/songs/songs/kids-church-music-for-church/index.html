As parents and teachers, we have the wonderful opportunity to guide our children in expressing their faith through joyful songs and meaningful worship experiences. Creating an environment where kids can freely worship helps them understand that praising God is both natural and enjoyable.</p>

<p>Just as birds sing their beautiful songs each morning, God gave us voices to praise Him too. When we worship, we&rsquo;re telling God how much we love Him and thanking Him for all He&rsquo;s done. Jesus loves to hear children&rsquo;s voices raised in praise â€“ remember how He welcomed the children and how they shouted &ldquo;Hosanna!&rdquo; in the temple?</p>
<p>Prayer: &ldquo;Dear Jesus, thank you for giving us music to praise you. Help us to sing with joy and remember that you love hearing our voices. Amen.&rdquo;</p>
