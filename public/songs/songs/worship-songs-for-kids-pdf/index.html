<p>God loves to hear children worship! Just like a parent delights in hearing their child sing, our Heavenly Father rejoices when we praise Him. Worship isn&rsquo;t about being perfect - it&rsquo;s about expressing our love for God from our hearts. Even Jesus welcomed children to come to Him, showing us that young voices matter in God&rsquo;s kingdom.</p>
<p>Dear God, thank you for loving our praise. Help us worship you with joy and truth. Amen.</p>
