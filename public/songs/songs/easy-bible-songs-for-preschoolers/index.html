<p>Just as birds sing their beautiful songs to start each day, God loves to hear our voices lifted in praise. When we sing about Jesus, we&rsquo;re telling Him how much we love Him, just like giving a musical hug to God! Every song we sing helps us remember that God is always with us and cares about everything we do.</p>
<p>Dear God, thank you for giving us songs to sing. Help us to praise you with happy hearts. Amen.</p>
<h3 id="faqs">FAQs</h3>
