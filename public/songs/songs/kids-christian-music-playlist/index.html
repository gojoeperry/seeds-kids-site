</li>
<li>
<p>Use hand motions with songs like &ldquo;This Little Light of Mine&rdquo; - have children create their own movements to express the lyrics</p>
</li>
<li>

<h3 id="devotional-thought">Devotional Thought</h3>
<p>Just as birds sing their beautiful songs to express joy, God gave us voices to sing His praises. When we worship through music, we&rsquo;re showing God our love and thankfulness for all He&rsquo;s done. Jesus loves to hear children&rsquo;s voices lifted in praise!</p>
<p>Prayer: Dear Jesus, thank you for the gift of music. Help us use our voices to praise You and share Your love with others. Amen.</p>
