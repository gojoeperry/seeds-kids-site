When we worship, we&rsquo;re telling God how much we love Him and thanking Him for all He&rsquo;s done. Jesus welcomes children&rsquo;s praise â€“ remember how He smiled when the children sang Hosanna? Your voice is special to God, and He loves hearing you sing to Him.</p>
<p>Prayer: &ldquo;Dear Jesus, thank you for giving us songs to sing. Help us worship you with happy hearts. Amen.&rdquo;</p>
