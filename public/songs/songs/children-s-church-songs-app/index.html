<h3 id="scripture">Scripture</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom, singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, with thankfulness in your hearts to God.&rdquo; - Colossians 3:16</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make a joyful noise to the Lord, all the earth!&rdquo; - Psalm 100:1</p>
<h2 id="worship-ideas">Worship Ideas</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Bible Heroes Parade&rdquo; - Have children march around the room while singing about different Bible characters, making motions for each hero (David&rsquo;s sling, Noah&rsquo;s ark, Moses&rsquo; staff).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Jesus Loves Me&rdquo; Action Time - Add simple hand motions to this classic song: crossing arms over heart for &ldquo;loves,&rdquo; pointing up for &ldquo;Jesus,&rdquo; and pointing to self for &ldquo;me.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Scripture Memory Songs&rdquo; - Choose apps featuring verses set to music, encouraging children to create their own hand motions to help remember the words.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="devotional-thought">Devotional Thought</h3>
<p>Just as God fills the world with beautiful music through birds singing and waves crashing, He wants us to fill our hearts and homes with songs of praise. When we worship through music, we&rsquo;re joining in with all of creation to tell God how much we love Him. Even Jesus sang songs with His disciples!</p>
<p>Prayer: &ldquo;Dear God, thank you for giving us music to praise You. Help us to sing with joy and share Your love with others through our songs. Amen.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Q: How can I incorporate app-based worship songs into our daily routine?</strong>
A: Try playing worship songs during morning routines, car rides, or quiet time. Make it interactive by learning the motions together, creating your own playlists, or using the songs as part of family devotions.</p>
