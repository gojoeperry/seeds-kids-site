<p>God loves to hear children worship! Just like parents treasure hearing their children sing, our Heavenly Father delights in our praise. When we worship, we&rsquo;re telling God how much we love Him and thanking Him for His goodness. Jesus said we should come to Him like little children, and worship is a perfect way to do that.</p>
<p>Prayer: &ldquo;Dear God, thank you for giving us voices to sing and hearts to love you. Help us worship you with joy! Amen.&rdquo;</p>
