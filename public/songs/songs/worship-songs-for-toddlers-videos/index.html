<p>&ldquo;Deep and Wide&rdquo; with Movement
Encourage little ones to spread their arms wide and squat down low, making the song interactive and fun. Add clapping rhythms to keep them engaged.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;This Little Light of Mine&rdquo;
Use finger motions and small flashlights to make this song come alive. Let kids &ldquo;shine&rdquo; their light in different directions.</p>

Every &ldquo;hallelujah&rdquo; and every tiny dance step brings joy to God&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p>Dear Jesus, thank you for loving our little ones. Help them grow to know and love you more each day through worship. Amen.</p>
