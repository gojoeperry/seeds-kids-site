<h3 id="scripture">Scripture</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise.&rdquo; - Psalm 98:4</p>

<h2 id="worship-ideas">Worship Ideas</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Jesus Loves Me&rdquo; with Sign Language
Have children learn basic sign language motions while singing this beloved hymn, engaging both voice and movement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;This Little Light of Mine&rdquo; Action Song
Kids hold up battery-operated tea lights or finger lights while singing, raising them high during the chorus and hiding them during &ldquo;hide it under a bushel - NO!&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s Got the Whole World in His Hands&rdquo;
Use inflatable globes or blue and green paper circles as props while singing about God&rsquo;s care for creation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="devotional-thought">Devotional Thought</h3>
<p>Just as birds wake up each morning singing their special songs, God gave us voices to praise Him too. When we sing together in worship, it&rsquo;s like joining a beautiful choir that God loves to hear. Every voice matters to Him - whether we sing perfectly or not. He simply loves hearing His children express their love through song.</p>
<p>Prayer: &ldquo;Dear God, thank you for giving us songs to sing and voices to praise you. Help us make joyful noise for you today! Amen.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="faqs">FAQs</h3>
