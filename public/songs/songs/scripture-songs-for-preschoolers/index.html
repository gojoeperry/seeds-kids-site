<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Teaching scripture songs for preschoolers is one of the most effective ways to plant God&rsquo;s Word in young hearts. When biblical truths are set to simple melodies and paired with fun movements, children naturally absorb and remember them. Scripture songs for preschoolers create a foundation of faith that can last a lifetime, turning Bible verses into treasured memories that the Holy Spirit can bring to mind for years to come. As parents and teachers, we have the amazing opportunity to make God&rsquo;s Word come alive through music, helping our littlest ones hide Scripture in their hearts from their earliest years. The combination of rhythm, repetition, and movement makes learning Bible verses both natural and enjoyable for young children.</p>
<h3 id="scripture">Scripture</h3>
<p>&ldquo;I have hidden your word in my heart that I might not sin against you.&rdquo; - Psalm 119:11</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly&hellip;singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs.&rdquo; - Colossians 3:16</p>
<h2 id="worship-ideas">Worship Ideas</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;The B-I-B-L-E&rdquo; with actions: Have children hold their hands like an open Bible, then point up to heaven when singing &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s the book for me!&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Jesus Loves Me&rdquo; verse memory: Add simple hand motions to help remember key words, like forming a heart shape for &ldquo;love&rdquo; and pointing to self for &ldquo;me.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create melody cards: Draw simple pictures representing different Bible verses and let children choose which scripture song to sing next.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="devotional-thought">Devotional Thought</h3>
<p>Just as we feed our bodies with good food to grow strong, we need to feed our hearts with God&rsquo;s Word. When we sing scripture songs, we&rsquo;re filling our hearts with God&rsquo;s love and truth. Jesus loves to hear children singing His Word, and He helps us remember these special songs even when we&rsquo;re having a hard day.</p>
<p>Dear Jesus, thank you for giving us your Word in the Bible. Help us to sing these songs with joy and remember that you love us. Amen.</p>
