<ol>
<li>
<p>What age should children start learning spiritual songs?
Children can start learning spiritual songs as early as infancy. Even babies respond to melodies, and toddlers naturally enjoy music. Simple songs like &ldquo;Jesus Loves Me&rdquo; are perfect for ages 2-5, while more complex songs can be introduced as children grow older.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can I make spiritual songs more engaging for kids?
Add hand motions, use props like scarves or instruments, and incorporate movement. Make it interactive by letting children take turns leading or creating their own motions. Using visual aids or telling the story behind the song can also help maintain interest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where can I find quality kids&rsquo; worship music?
