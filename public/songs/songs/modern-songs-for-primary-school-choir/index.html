<p>&ldquo;Let everything that has breath praise the Lord. Praise the Lord!&rdquo; - Psalm 150:6</p>
<h2 id="worship-ideas">Worship Ideas</h2>

</ol>
<h3 id="devotional-thought">Devotional Thought</h3>
<p>Just as each instrument in an orchestra has its unique sound, God has given each of us a special voice to praise Him. When we sing together in choir, we&rsquo;re like different colored crayons creating a beautiful picture of worship. Jesus loves hearing our voices joined together in praise, no matter if we&rsquo;re singing loud or soft, high or low.</p>
<p>Dear God, thank you for giving us voices to sing your praise. Help us to worship you with joy and love. Amen.</p>
