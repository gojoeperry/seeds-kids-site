<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Introducing your children to worship through a kids praise songs CD can be one of the most powerful ways to nurture their spiritual growth.

<h3 id="scripture">Scripture</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Let everything that has breath praise the Lord!&rdquo; (Psalm 150:6)
&ldquo;Make a joyful noise to the Lord, all the earth!&rdquo; (Psalm 100:1)</p>
<h2 id="worship-ideas">Worship Ideas</h2>

<li>&ldquo;Jesus Loves Me Rock&rdquo; - Have kids hop on one foot during verses and jump with both feet during the chorus while singing</li>
<li>&ldquo;Every Move I Make&rdquo; - Create simple hand motions that follow the lyrics, having children mirror your movements</li>
<li>&ldquo;Father Abraham&rdquo; - This classic action song gets everyone moving and laughing while learning about faith</li>

<h3 id="devotional-thought">Devotional Thought</h3>
<p>Just like birds sing their beautiful songs to start each day, God loves to hear our voices lifted in praise. When we sing worship songs, we&rsquo;re telling God how much we love Him and thanking Him for all He&rsquo;s done. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if we&rsquo;re the best singers - what matters is that our hearts are full of joy for Jesus.</p>
<p>Prayer: &ldquo;Dear God, thank you for giving us music to praise you. Help us remember that you love hearing our voices, whether we&rsquo;re singing loud or soft. Amen.&rdquo;</p>
