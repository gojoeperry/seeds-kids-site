When we sing Scripture, we&rsquo;re following Jesus&rsquo; example of making God&rsquo;s truth accessible and memorable. Let&rsquo;s pray: &ldquo;Dear God, thank you for giving us music to help us learn about You. Help us to hide Your Word in our hearts through songs and remember Your love for us. Amen.&rdquo;</p>
