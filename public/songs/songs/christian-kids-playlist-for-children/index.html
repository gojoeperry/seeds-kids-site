<h3 id="scripture">Scripture</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom, singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, with thankfulness in your hearts to God.&rdquo; - Colossians 3:16</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make a joyful noise to the Lord, all the earth!&rdquo; - Psalm 100:1</p>

<h3 id="devotional-thought">Devotional Thought</h3>
<p>Just as David danced before the Lord with all his might, God loves when we worship Him with joy and enthusiasm. Our praise doesn&rsquo;t have to be perfect â€“ it just needs to come from our hearts. When we sing and dance for Jesus, we&rsquo;re showing Him how much we love Him, just like how we might sing or dance for someone&rsquo;s birthday to show them we care.</p>
<p>Dear God, thank you for giving us music to praise You. Help us worship You with joy and teach others about Your love through our songs. Amen.</p>
