<h3 id="devotional-thought">Devotional Thought</h3>
<p>God loves to hear children worship Him! Just like parents treasure hearing their children say &ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; our Heavenly Father delights in the praise of His little ones. When we sing to God, we&rsquo;re telling Him how much we love Him and thank Him for all He&rsquo;s done for us. Even Jesus welcomed children to come to Him, showing us that no one is too young to worship.</p>
<p>Dear God, thank you for giving us voices to sing and hearts to love You. Help us worship You with joy! Amen.</p>
<h3 id="faqs">FAQs</h3>
<p>Q: What age should children start learning worship songs?

<p>Q: How can I make worship time more engaging for kids?
A: Incorporate actions, hand motions, and simple instruments to make worship interactive. Use visual aids like pictures or puppets, take song requests, and let children lead sometimes. Keep sessions short and energetic to maintain attention.</p>
