<p>Just as God fills the world with beautiful music through birds singing and waves crashing, He wants us to fill our hearts with songs about His love. When we sing worship songs, we&rsquo;re joining with all of creation in praising our Creator. Even when we feel sad or scared, we can remember the happy songs about God&rsquo;s care for us.</p>
<p>Dear God, thank you for giving us music to help us learn about your love. Help us to sing joyfully and remember that you are always with us. Amen.</p>
