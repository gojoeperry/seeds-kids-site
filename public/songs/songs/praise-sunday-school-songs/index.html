<p>God loves to hear our voices raised in praise! Just like parents love to hear their children say &ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; our Heavenly Father delights in our worship. When we sing praise songs, we&rsquo;re telling God how much we love Him and thanking Him for His goodness. Every time we sing, we can remember that God is smiling, listening to our voices joined together in praise.</p>
<p>Prayer: &ldquo;Dear God, thank you for giving us songs to sing. Help us to praise You with joy in our hearts. Amen.&rdquo;</p>
