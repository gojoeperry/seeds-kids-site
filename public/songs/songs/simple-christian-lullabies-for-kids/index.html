<p>&ldquo;When you lie down, you will not be afraid; when you lie down, your sleep will be sweet.&rdquo; - Proverbs 3:24</p>

<h3 id="devotional-thought">Devotional Thought</h3>
<p>Just as loving parents tuck their children into bed each night, our Heavenly Father watches over us as we sleep. He never slumbers or sleeps, keeping us safe through the night. When we sing gentle lullabies about Jesus, we remind ourselves and our children that God&rsquo;s love surrounds us always.</p>
<p>Prayer: &ldquo;Dear Jesus, thank you for staying with me while I sleep. Help me rest peacefully, knowing you are near. Amen.&rdquo;</p>
