<p>&ldquo;When you lie down, you will not be afraid; when you lie down, your sleep will be sweet.&rdquo; - Proverbs 3:24</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Lord your God is with you, he is mighty to save. He will take great delight in you, he will quiet you with his love.&rdquo; - Zephaniah 3:17</p>
<h2 id="worship-ideas">Worship Ideas</h2>
<ol>
<li>&ldquo;Jesus Loves Me Lullaby&rdquo; - Sing the traditional song at a slower pace, adding gentle swaying motions</li>
<li>&ldquo;Guardian Angel Prayer Song&rdquo; - Create a simple melody using the prayer &ldquo;Angel of God, my guardian dear&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Bedtime Blessing Circle&rdquo; - Hold hands as a family and sing &ldquo;God is so good&rdquo; while gently swaying before bed</li>
</ol>
<p>Include soft hand motions and encourage children to hum along as they get sleepy. These activities work perfectly for both home bedtime routines and church nursery settings.</p>
<h3 id="devotional-thought">Devotional Thought</h3>
<p>Just as we feel safe and loved in our warm beds at night, God&rsquo;s love surrounds us all the time. He watches over us while we sleep, just like a loving parent. Jesus wants to be close to us during both our busy daytime activities and our quiet nighttime rest.</p>
<p>Dear God, thank you for watching over us as we sleep. Help us remember that you are always with us, keeping us safe and sharing your love. Amen.</p>

<h3 id="what-age-is-appropriate-to-start-using-christian-lullabies">What age is appropriate to start using Christian lullabies?</h3>
