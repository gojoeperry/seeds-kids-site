<h3 id="devotional-thought">Devotional Thought</h3>
<p>Just as birds sing their beautiful songs to fill the morning air, God gives us voices to sing His praises. When we download and share gospel music with children, we&rsquo;re teaching them that worship can be fun and that God loves to hear their voices. Jesus said to let the little children come to Him, and music is one of the most natural ways for kids to draw near to God.</p>
<p>Dear God, thank you for the gift of music and for helping us learn about your love through songs. Help us to sing with joy and share your message with others. Amen.</p>
