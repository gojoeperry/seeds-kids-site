Finding the perfect Bible verses about God&rsquo;s love helps establish a strong spiritual foundation and helps children understand their special place in God&rsquo;s family. Teaching kids about God&rsquo;s love through memorable verses creates lasting impressions that can shape their faith journey for years to come.

<h3 id="scripture">Scripture</h3>
<p>&ldquo;For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.&rdquo; - John 3:16</p>
<p>&ldquo;See what great love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God!&rdquo; - 1 John 3:1</p>
<h2 id="worship-ideas">Worship Ideas</h2>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Create heart-shaped cards with love verses written inside. Let kids decorate them with stickers and give them to family members or friends.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Sing &ldquo;Jesus Loves Me&rdquo; with hand motions: crossing arms over chest for &ldquo;loves,&rdquo; pointing up for &ldquo;Jesus,&rdquo; and pointing to self for &ldquo;me.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Play &ldquo;God&rsquo;s Love Hot Potato&rdquo; - pass a heart-shaped pillow while music plays. When the music stops, the child holding it shares one way they know God loves them.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="devotional-thought">Devotional Thought</h3>
<p>God&rsquo;s love is like a big, warm hug that never ends. Just like your parents love you no matter what, God&rsquo;s love is even bigger and stronger. He loved us so much that He sent Jesus to be our forever friend. When we feel scared, sad, or alone, we can remember that God&rsquo;s love is always with us, just like a nightlight in the dark.</p>
<p>Dear God, thank you for loving us so much. Help us to share your love with others today. Amen.</p>

<p>Children can start learning about God&rsquo;s love as early as age 2-3 through simple songs and stories. By ages 4-6, they can begin memorizing short verses, and older children can explore deeper meanings of Scripture about God&rsquo;s love.</p>
