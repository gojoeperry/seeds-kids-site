<h3 id="devotional-thought">Devotional Thought</h3>
<p>God gave us voices and bodies to praise Him! Just like birds sing their beautiful songs, we can sing to show God how much we love Him. When we worship with songs, it makes God happy, and it makes us happy too. Jesus loves to hear children&rsquo;s voices lifted in praise.</p>
<p>Prayer: &ldquo;Dear Jesus, thank you for music and songs. Help us use our voices to show our love for you. Amen.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="faqs">FAQs</h3>
<p><strong>Q: What age should I start teaching faith songs to my child?</strong>
A: You can start introducing faith songs from birth! Babies and toddlers naturally respond to music, and even if they can&rsquo;t sing along yet, they absorb the melodies and messages. By age 2-3, most children can participate actively in simple songs with motions.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How can I make worship songs more engaging for my preschooler?</strong>
A: Add simple hand motions, use props like scarves or instruments, and incorporate movement like jumping or dancing. Keep sessions short (5-10 minutes) and repeat favorite songs often. Make it playful and never force participation.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Where can I find good worship songs for preschoolers?</strong>
A: Look for children&rsquo;s worship videos on YouTube, Christian streaming services, or purchase kids&rsquo; worship CDs. Many churches also offer preschool music resources. Popular artists like Yancy, Seeds Family Worship, and Hillsong Kids create age-appropriate worship music for young children.</p>
