<p>Just as loving parents tuck their children into bed each night, our Heavenly Father watches over us with endless love and care. When we feel scared or alone in the dark, we can remember that God is always awake, keeping us safe and close to His heart. Even as we sleep, His love never stops.</p>
<p>Prayer: &ldquo;Dear God, thank you for watching over me while I sleep. Help me feel your love and peace as I rest. Amen.&rdquo;</p>
