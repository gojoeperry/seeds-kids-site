<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Listener Kids This Little Light of Mine&rdquo; has become a beloved children&rsquo;s worship song that teaches vital spiritual truths through its simple, engaging lyrics. This timeless tune helps children understand that they each carry God&rsquo;s light within them and have the special responsibility to share it with the world. When kids sing &ldquo;Listener Kids This Little Light of Mine,&rdquo; they&rsquo;re not just learning a catchy melody – they&rsquo;re internalizing the important message that even small actions can make a big difference for God&rsquo;s kingdom. The song&rsquo;s repetitive nature and easy-to-follow motions make it perfect for young worshippers, while its profound message resonates with believers of all ages.</p>
<h3 id="scripture">Scripture</h3>
<p>&ldquo;You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden.&rdquo; - Matthew 5:14</p>
<p>&ldquo;For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Live as children of light.&rdquo; - Ephesians 5:8</p>
<h2 id="worship-ideas">Worship Ideas</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Light and Share: Give each child a battery-operated tea light and form a circle. As they sing, have them &ldquo;hide&rdquo; and &ldquo;shine&rdquo; their lights according to the lyrics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mission Moments: Create simple actions for each verse (pointing up for &ldquo;shine,&rdquo; cupping hands for &ldquo;hide,&rdquo; blowing for &ldquo;won&rsquo;t let Satan blow it out&rdquo;). Let children take turns leading the motions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Light Chain: After singing, have children write or draw ways they can share God&rsquo;s light on paper strips, then connect them into a classroom chain.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="devotional-thought">Devotional Thought</h3>
<p>Just like a small flashlight can light up a dark room, our small acts of kindness and love can shine God&rsquo;s light in a dark world. Jesus wants us to be brave and let our lights shine by being kind, telling the truth, and sharing His love with others. We don&rsquo;t need to be grown up or special – God can use even the smallest light to make a big difference.</p>
<p>Dear God, help us be brave and let our lights shine bright for You. Thank you for putting Your light inside us. Amen.</p>
