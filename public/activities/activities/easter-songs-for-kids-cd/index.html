<p>Jesus showed His great love for us by dying on the cross and rising again. When we sing Easter songs, we&rsquo;re telling this amazing story of God&rsquo;s love. Just like the birds sing in the morning to welcome a new day, we can sing to celebrate the new life Jesus gives us. Let&rsquo;s remember that Easter isn&rsquo;t just about bunnies and eggs â€“ it&rsquo;s about Jesus being alive and loving us forever!</p>
<p>Prayer: Dear Jesus, thank you for loving us so much. Help us sing with joy about your resurrection. Amen.</p>
