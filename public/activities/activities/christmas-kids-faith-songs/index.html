<h3 id="devotional-thought">Devotional Thought</h3>
<p>Jesus came as a tiny baby to show us God&rsquo;s amazing love. Just like the shepherds and wise men brought their gifts to Jesus, we can bring Him our gift of worship through songs. When we sing about Jesus&rsquo; birth, we&rsquo;re telling the wonderful story of God&rsquo;s greatest gift to us. Every time we sing these special songs, we&rsquo;re showing Jesus how much we love Him.</p>
<p>Dear Jesus, thank you for coming as a baby on Christmas. Help us to sing with joy and share your love with others. Amen.</p>
