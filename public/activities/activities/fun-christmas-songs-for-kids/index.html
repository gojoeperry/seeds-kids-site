<h3 id="devotional-thought">Devotional Thought</h3>
<p>Jesus came as a baby to show us God&rsquo;s amazing love. When we sing Christmas songs, we&rsquo;re telling the story of how God sent His Son to be with us. Just like the angels sang to announce Jesus&rsquo;s birth, we can sing to celebrate Him too! Every time we sing these fun songs, we&rsquo;re reminding ourselves and others about God&rsquo;s greatest gift.</p>
<p>Prayer: &ldquo;Dear Jesus, thank you for coming as a baby and for loving us so much. Help us to share your joy through our songs this Christmas. Amen.&rdquo;</p>
