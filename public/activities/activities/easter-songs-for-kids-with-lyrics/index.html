<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Easter songs for kids with lyrics provide a wonderful way to teach children about the incredible story of Jesus&rsquo; resurrection through music and movement. These engaging worship songs help young hearts understand and remember the true meaning of Easter while creating joyful moments of praise. When children learn easter songs for kids with lyrics, they not only develop their musical abilities but also build a strong foundation of faith. The combination of simple melodies, meaningful words, and interactive movements makes these songs perfect for Sunday school classes, family worship times, or children&rsquo;s church programs. Teaching kids to worship through Easter-themed music helps them express their love for Jesus and understand His amazing sacrifice and victory over death.</p>
<h3 id="scripture">Scripture</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Jesus said to her, &lsquo;I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live, even though they die.&rsquo;&rdquo; - John 11:25</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is not here; he has risen, just as he said.&rdquo; - Matthew 28:6</p>
<h2 id="worship-ideas">Worship Ideas</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Jesus Is Alive&rdquo; - Have children make victory signs while jumping up and down during the chorus. Add hand motions showing the empty tomb and Jesus rising.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Easter Morning Joy&rdquo; - Create a simple circle dance where kids walk forward four steps, then back four steps. During the chorus, have them spin around with arms raised in celebration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s Risen Indeed&rdquo; - Use colorful scarves or ribbons while singing, waving them high during &ldquo;Alleluia&rdquo; moments and creating cross shapes during verses.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="devotional-thought">Devotional Thought</h3>
<p>Just as flowers bloom in spring bringing new life, Jesus gives us new life through His resurrection. When Jesus rose from the dead, He showed us that God&rsquo;s love is stronger than anything - even death! Every time we sing Easter songs, we&rsquo;re telling this amazing story of God&rsquo;s love and power.</p>
<p>Prayer: Dear Jesus, thank you for dying for us and rising again. Help us remember Your love every time we sing. We love You! Amen.</p>
