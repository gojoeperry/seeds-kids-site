<li>&ldquo;Jesus Is Alive&rdquo; - A bouncy song with simple motions (jumping on &ldquo;alive,&rdquo; making cross shapes with arms)</li>
<li>&ldquo;Easter Morning Celebration&rdquo; - Use egg shakers or ribbons while singing about the empty tomb</li>
<li>&ldquo;God&rsquo;s Love Is Like a Party&rdquo; - Create a parade around the room with streamers and tambourines</li>

This amazing gift means we can be God&rsquo;s children forever!</p>
<p>Prayer: Dear Jesus, thank you for loving us so much that you died and rose again. Help us celebrate your love with happy songs and grateful hearts. Amen.</p>
