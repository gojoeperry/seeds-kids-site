<p>Jesus came as a tiny baby to show us how much God loves us. Just like the shepherds and angels sang songs of praise when Jesus was born, we can sing and celebrate too! When we worship with Christmas songs, we&rsquo;re telling Jesus &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; for coming to earth to be our Savior.</p>
<p>Prayer: Dear Jesus, thank you for being born in Bethlehem. Help us remember you are the reason we celebrate Christmas. We love to sing songs about you! Amen.</p>
