<p>Jesus came to earth as a tiny baby because He loves us so much. Just like we prepare our homes for Christmas with decorations and gifts, we can prepare our hearts to welcome Jesus. When we sing Christmas songs about Jesus, we&rsquo;re telling Him how happy we are that He came to be our Savior.</p>
<p>Prayer: &ldquo;Dear Jesus, thank you for coming as a baby on Christmas. Help us remember that Christmas is all about celebrating You. We love you! Amen.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="faqs">FAQs</h3>
<p><strong>What age group are Christmas vacation Bible school songs best suited for?</strong>
