<h3 id="devotional-thought">Devotional Thought</h3>
<p>Jesus came as a tiny baby because He loves us so much. He grew up and showed us God&rsquo;s love, then died on the cross and rose again to save us. When we sing about both Christmas and Easter, we remember that Jesus&rsquo;s whole life was part of God&rsquo;s amazing plan for us.</p>
<p>Dear Jesus, thank you for coming as a baby and for dying for our sins. Help us remember your love when we sing. Amen.</p>
