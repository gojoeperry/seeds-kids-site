<h3 id="scripture">Scripture</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Sing to the Lord a new song; sing to the Lord, all the earth.&rdquo; - Psalm 96:1</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let everything that has breath praise the Lord. Praise the Lord!&rdquo; - Psalm 150:6</p>
<h2 id="worship-ideas">Worship Ideas</h2>
<p>Start with &ldquo;Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Prayer&rdquo; - a fun adaptation of the classic children&rsquo;s song where kids touch each body part and end in a prayer position. Follow with &ldquo;This Little Light of Mine,&rdquo; using finger motions to represent the light and adding whole-body movements when &ldquo;letting it shine.&rdquo; Create a simple percussion band using rice shakers (plastic eggs filled with rice) for &ldquo;Jesus Loves Me,&rdquo; allowing kids to keep rhythm while singing.</p>
