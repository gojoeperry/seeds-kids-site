<p>Jesus came as a tiny baby to show us how much God loves us. Just like parents care for their babies, God cares for each of us. When we sing Christmas songs, we&rsquo;re telling the story of God&rsquo;s greatest gift - Jesus! Even the angels sang when Jesus was born, and we can join their celebration.</p>
<p>Prayer: &ldquo;Dear Jesus, thank you for coming as a baby and for loving us so much. Help us share your love through our songs this Christmas. Amen.&rdquo;</p>
