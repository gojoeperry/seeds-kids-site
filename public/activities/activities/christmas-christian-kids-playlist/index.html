<h3 id="scripture">Scripture</h3>
<p>&ldquo;For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.&rdquo; - Isaiah 9:6</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.&rdquo; - Luke 2:14</p>
<h2 id="worship-ideas">Worship Ideas</h2>
<ol>
<li>&ldquo;Joy to the World&rdquo; with jumping actions: Jump on &ldquo;Joy,&rdquo; spin around on &ldquo;World,&rdquo; and raise hands for &ldquo;Let earth receive her King&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Away in a Manger&rdquo; with gentle motions: Rock pretend baby Jesus, point to stars, make animal sounds</li>
<li>&ldquo;Go Tell It on the Mountain&rdquo; with movement stations: Create different actions for mountain, shepherds, and manger scenes</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="devotional-thought">Devotional Thought</h3>
<p>Jesus came as a tiny baby to show us how much God loves us. Just like parents prepare special gifts for Christmas, God gave us the most amazing gift - His Son! When we sing Christmas songs, we&rsquo;re like the angels who praised God on that first Christmas night. Let&rsquo;s remember that every time we sing these special songs, we&rsquo;re celebrating God&rsquo;s perfect gift of love.</p>
<p>Prayer: Dear Jesus, thank you for coming as a baby to show us God&rsquo;s love. Help us sing with joy and share your love with others this Christmas. Amen.</p>
