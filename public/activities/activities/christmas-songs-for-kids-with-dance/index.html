<h3 id="devotional-thought">Devotional Thought</h3>
<p>Just as the angels danced and sang to celebrate Jesus&rsquo;s birth, we too can praise God with our whole bodies. When we dance and sing for Jesus, we&rsquo;re showing Him how happy we are that He came to earth as our Savior. Every jump, twirl, and motion can be a gift of praise to God.</p>
<p>Prayer: Dear Jesus, thank you for giving us music and dance to praise you. Help us share your joy with others through our songs and movements. Amen.</p>
