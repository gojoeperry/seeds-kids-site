<h3 id="scripture">Scripture</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.&rdquo; - Matthew 19:14</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth!&rdquo; - Psalm 100:1</p>
<h2 id="worship-ideas">Worship Ideas</h2>
<ol>

<li>&ldquo;God&rsquo;s Love Is Like a Sunshine&rdquo; - Have children form a circle, holding hands, and spin while raising arms like growing flowers</li>
<li>&ldquo;The B-I-B-L-E&rdquo; with animal sounds - Incorporate different animal noises at each letter, making the classic song more engaging for preschoolers</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="devotional-thought">Devotional Thought</h3>
<p>Just as birds sing their beautiful songs each morning, God wants us to sing joyfully to Him too! When we sing VBS songs, we&rsquo;re telling God how much we love Him, just like giving a big hug to someone special. God loves hearing our voices, whether we sing quietly or loudly, because He loves everything about us.</p>
<p>Dear God, thank you for giving us happy songs to sing. Help us remember that you love hearing our voices. Amen.</p>
<h3 id="faqs">FAQs</h3>
<h3 id="what-age-is-best-to-start-teaching-vbs-songs-to-children">What age is best to start teaching VBS songs to children?</h3>
<p>Children as young as 2-3 years old can begin learning simple VBS songs. At this age, they naturally respond to music and can participate in basic motions. Start with short, repetitive songs and gradually introduce more complex ones as they grow.</p>
<h3 id="how-can-i-help-my-preschooler-remember-vbs-songs-at-home">How can I help my preschooler remember VBS songs at home?</h3>
<p>Make singing part of your daily routine - during car rides, bath time, or before bed. Use hand motions, create simple dance moves, or incorporate props like stuffed animals. Regular repetition helps children retain both the melody and the message.</p>
<h3 id="where-can-i-find-good-vbs-theme-songs-for-preschoolers">Where can I find good VBS theme songs for preschoolers?</h3>
<p>Look for resources from major Christian publishers like Group Publishing, LifeWay, or Orange Kids. Many offer free sample songs online. Your local Christian bookstore likely carries VBS music collections, and YouTube channels dedicated to children&rsquo;s worship music can be excellent resources. Always preview content to ensure it&rsquo;s age-appropriate for your preschoolers.</p>
