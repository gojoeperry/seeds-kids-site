<p>&ldquo;But let all who take refuge in you be glad; let them ever sing for joy.&rdquo; - Psalm 5:11</p>

<h3 id="devotional-thought">Devotional Thought</h3>
<p>Just like the ocean is full of endless waves, God&rsquo;s love for us never runs dry. When we&rsquo;re at the beach, we can see, hear, and feel the power of the waves - that&rsquo;s how God&rsquo;s love surrounds us too! He created the mighty ocean and every creature in it, and He created you with the same amazing care and attention.</p>
<p>Dear God, thank you for loving us as big as the ocean. Help us remember your love when we sing and dance to worship you. Amen.</p>
