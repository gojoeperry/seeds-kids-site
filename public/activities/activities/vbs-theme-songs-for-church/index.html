<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>VBS theme songs for church play a vital role in helping children connect with God through music and movement. These engaging melodies and lyrics become powerful tools that stick with kids long after Vacation Bible School ends, reinforcing biblical truths in their hearts. When selecting VBS theme songs for church programs, it&rsquo;s important to choose music that combines fun, biblical teaching, and memorable tunes that children will want to sing again and again. These songs create lasting memories while planting seeds of faith that can grow throughout their spiritual journey. Whether you&rsquo;re planning a summer VBS program or looking to incorporate these dynamic worship songs into your regular children&rsquo;s ministry, theme songs help create an atmosphere of joy and excitement about learning God&rsquo;s Word.</p>
<h3 id="scripture">Scripture</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise.&rdquo; - Psalm 98:4</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let everything that has breath praise the Lord. Praise the Lord!&rdquo; - Psalm 150:6</p>
<h2 id="worship-ideas">Worship Ideas</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;God&rsquo;s Love Is Like a Lighthouse&rdquo; - Have children make wave motions with their arms and spin like a lighthouse beam while singing about God&rsquo;s guiding light.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Jesus&rsquo; Power Pulls Us Through&rdquo; - Create a train formation where kids hold onto each other&rsquo;s shoulders and move around the room, demonstrating how Jesus leads us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Building on the Rock&rdquo; - Use building motions (hammering, sawing, lifting) while singing about having faith as your foundation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="devotional-thought">Devotional Thought</h3>
<p>Just as different instruments come together to make beautiful music, God created each of us uniquely to praise Him in our own special way. When we sing VBS songs, we&rsquo;re joining with other children around the world to tell God how much we love Him. He delights in hearing our voices, whether we&rsquo;re good singers or not!</p>
<p>Prayer: &ldquo;Dear God, thank you for giving us music to praise you. Help us to sing with joy and share your love with others. Amen.&rdquo;</p>
