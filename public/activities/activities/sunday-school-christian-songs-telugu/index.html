<p>Prayer: &ldquo;Dear Jesus, thank you for giving us songs to sing about your love. Help us to worship you with joy in our hearts. Amen.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="faqs">FAQs</h3>
<p><strong>Q: What age group are Telugu Sunday school songs most suitable for?</strong>
A: Telugu Sunday school songs are typically designed for children aged 3-12 years old, with simpler songs for younger children and more complex lyrics for older ones. The melodies and actions can be adapted to suit different age groups.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How can I teach Telugu Christian songs to children who don&rsquo;t speak Telugu fluently?</strong>
