</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="devotional-thought">Devotional Thought</h3>
<p>Jesus came as a tiny baby to show us that God&rsquo;s love comes in surprising packages. Just like the shepherds who were amazed to find the King of Kings in a manger, we can find God&rsquo;s presence in unexpected places. When we sing Christmas songs, we&rsquo;re joining with the angels who praised God on that first Christmas night.</p>
<p>Dear Jesus, thank you for coming as a baby and showing us how much you love us. Help us remember the true meaning of Christmas as we sing your praises. Amen.</p>
