<h3 id="devotional-thought">Devotional Thought</h3>
<p>God made us to worship Him with our whole selves – our voices, our bodies, and our hearts. When toddlers sing and move to worship songs, they&rsquo;re expressing love for Jesus in their own special way. Just as Jesus welcomed children during His ministry, He delights in hearing their sweet voices today.</p>
<p>Prayer: &ldquo;Dear Jesus, thank you for loving little children. Help us make joyful music for you. Amen.&rdquo;</p>
