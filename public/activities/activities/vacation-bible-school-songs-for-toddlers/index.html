When toddlers participate in vacation bible school songs, they&rsquo;re not just learning melodies – they&rsquo;re absorbing biblical truths in a format they can understand and enjoy.

<h3 id="scripture">Scripture</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.&rdquo; - Matthew 19:14</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth.&rdquo; - Psalm 100:1</p>

<h3 id="devotional-thought">Devotional Thought</h3>
<p>God made us to worship Him with our whole selves – our voices, our bodies, and our hearts. When toddlers sing and move to worship songs, they&rsquo;re expressing love for Jesus in their own special way. Just as Jesus welcomed children during His ministry, He delights in hearing their sweet voices today.</p>
<p>Prayer: &ldquo;Dear Jesus, thank you for loving little children. Help us make joyful music for you. Amen.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="faqs">FAQs</h3>
