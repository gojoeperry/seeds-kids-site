<h3 id="devotional-thought">Devotional Thought</h3>
<p>Just as the angels sang to announce Jesus&rsquo;s birth, we can use our voices and actions to celebrate Him too. When we sing and move in worship, we&rsquo;re showing God how happy we are that He sent Jesus to be our Savior. Remember, worship isn&rsquo;t just about singing the right words – it&rsquo;s about showing love to God with our whole hearts and bodies.</p>
<p>Dear God, thank you for giving us songs to sing and ways to praise you. Help us remember the true meaning of Christmas as we worship you with joy. Amen.</p>
