<p>Jesus came as a tiny baby to show us how much God loves us. Just like the shepherds and angels sang songs of praise when Jesus was born, we can sing songs to celebrate His birth today. When we sing Christmas songs, we&rsquo;re telling the story of God&rsquo;s greatest gift to us – His Son Jesus.</p>
<p>Prayer: &ldquo;Dear Jesus, thank you for coming as a baby on Christmas. Help us remember you are the reason we celebrate. We love you! Amen.&rdquo;</p>
