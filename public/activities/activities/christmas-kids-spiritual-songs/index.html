<h3 id="devotional-thought">Devotional Thought</h3>
<p>Jesus came as a tiny baby to show us how much God loves us. When we sing Christmas songs about His birth, we&rsquo;re telling the most amazing story ever told! Just like the angels sang to announce Jesus&rsquo;s birth, we can use our voices to praise Him and share His love with others. Think about how special it is that God chose to send His Son as a baby, just like you once were.</p>
<p>Prayer: &ldquo;Dear Jesus, thank you for coming as a baby and for loving us so much. Help us to sing about you with joy in our hearts. Amen.&rdquo;</p>
