<h3 id="scripture">Scripture</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Jesus said, &lsquo;Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.&rsquo;&rdquo; - Matthew 19:14</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is not here; he has risen, just as he said.&rdquo; - Matthew 28:6</p>
<h2 id="worship-ideas">Worship Ideas</h2>

</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Easter Morning Praise Parade&rdquo; - Create a joyful procession with children waving palm branches or colorful streamers while singing about Jesus&rsquo;s victory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;God&rsquo;s Love Is Like a Garden&rdquo; - Use simple hand motions to demonstrate growing from a seed, blooming, and reaching toward the sun, connecting spring themes to resurrection life.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="devotional-thought">Devotional Thought</h3>
<p>Just as flowers break through the ground in spring, Jesus broke free from the tomb to give us new life. His resurrection shows us that God&rsquo;s love is stronger than anything - even death! When we sing Easter songs, we&rsquo;re celebrating this amazing gift of love and new beginnings.</p>
<p>Dear Jesus, thank you for loving us so much that you died and rose again. Help us share your joy through our songs and praise. Amen.</p>
<h3 id="faqs">FAQs</h3>
