<p>Jesus came as a baby to show us God&rsquo;s amazing love. When we sing Christmas songs, we&rsquo;re celebrating His birthday and telling others about His gift of salvation. Just like the angels sang to announce Jesus&rsquo;s birth, we can use our voices and actions to praise Him too. Every time we sing and move to worship songs, we&rsquo;re showing Jesus how much we love Him.</p>
<p>Dear Jesus, thank you for coming as a baby and for giving us music to praise you. Help us share your joy with others through our songs and actions. Amen.</p>
