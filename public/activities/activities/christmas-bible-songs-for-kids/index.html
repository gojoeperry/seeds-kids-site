<li>
<p>&ldquo;Away in a Manger&rdquo; with hand motions: Have children rock their arms like holding a baby during &ldquo;asleep,&rdquo; point up for &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; and make a star with their hands for &ldquo;sky.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;The Birthday of a King&rdquo; action song: Create a simple dance where kids march like kings, kneel like shepherds, and spread their arms wide like angels.</p>

<h3 id="devotional-thought">Devotional Thought</h3>
<p>Just as the shepherds and wise men brought their best gifts to baby Jesus, we can bring our gift of praise through song. When we sing about Jesus&rsquo;s birth, we&rsquo;re telling the most important story ever told - how God loved us so much that He sent His Son to earth as a tiny baby. Our songs are like presents we give back to God.</p>
<p>Prayer: &ldquo;Dear Jesus, thank you for coming to earth as a baby. Help us remember the true meaning of Christmas as we sing songs about your birth. We love you! Amen.&rdquo;</p>
