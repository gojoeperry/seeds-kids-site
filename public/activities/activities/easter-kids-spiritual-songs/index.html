<p>Just as the sun rises each morning, Jesus rose on Easter morning to give us new life. His love for us is bigger than anything we can imagine! When we sing songs about Easter, we&rsquo;re telling the story of how Jesus showed His amazing love by dying for us and coming back to life. We can celebrate this wonderful gift every day.</p>
<p>Prayer: Dear Jesus, thank you for loving us so much. Help us to remember the joy of Easter as we sing and worship you. Amen.</p>
