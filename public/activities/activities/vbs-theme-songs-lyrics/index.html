<h3 id="scripture">Scripture</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Let everything that has breath praise the Lord! Praise the Lord!&rdquo; - Psalm 150:6</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sing to him, sing praise to him; tell of all his wonderful acts.&rdquo; - Psalm 105:2</p>
<h2 id="worship-ideas">Worship Ideas</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Every Move I Make&rdquo; - Have kids form a circle and follow simple motions: jumping on &ldquo;move,&rdquo; pointing up for &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; and spinning for &ldquo;dance.&rdquo; This energetic song teaches about God&rsquo;s presence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;This Little Light of Mine&rdquo; - Give each child a battery-operated tea light to hold up during the chorus. Add verses about shining at home, school, and church.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Jesus Loves Me Rock&rdquo; - Create hand motions for each verse and encourage kids to make up their own moves to express God&rsquo;s love.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="devotional-thought">Devotional Thought</h3>
<p>Just like a beautiful song has different parts that work together, God made each of us unique but part of His wonderful plan. When we sing VBS songs, we&rsquo;re joining with other children around the world to praise Jesus. He loves hearing our voices, whether we&rsquo;re good singers or not, because He cares about our hearts more than perfect notes.</p>
<p>Dear God, thank you for giving us music to praise You. Help us remember these songs and Your love throughout the year. Amen.</p>
