<p>&ldquo;Glory to God in the highest heaven, and on earth peace to those on whom his favor rests.&rdquo; - Luke 2:14</p>

<h2 id="worship-ideas">Worship Ideas</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Star of Bethlehem Dance&rdquo; - Have children hold star cutouts while twirling and moving to peaceful Christmas worship music. Each time the music pauses, they can freeze and point their stars toward &ldquo;baby Jesus&rdquo; (a designated spot).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Birthday Party for Jesus&rdquo; - Combine familiar Christmas carols with birthday party motions. During &ldquo;Joy to the World,&rdquo; children can throw pretend confetti and celebrate Jesus&rsquo;s birth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Silent Night Actions&rdquo; - Teach simple hand motions for each verse, helping children connect the story with gentle movements.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Prayer: &ldquo;Dear Jesus, thank you for coming as a baby to show us God&rsquo;s love. Help us share your joy through our songs this Christmas. Amen.&rdquo;</p>
