<h3 id="devotional-thought">Devotional Thought</h3>
<p>Jesus came to earth as a tiny baby to show us how much God loves us. When we sing Christmas worship songs, we&rsquo;re telling Jesus &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; for being our special gift from heaven. Just like the angels sang to celebrate Jesus&rsquo;s birth, we can sing and make joyful music to worship Him too!</p>
<p>Prayer: &ldquo;Dear Jesus, thank you for coming to earth as a baby. Help us remember that Christmas is all about you. We love to sing songs that make you happy. Amen.&rdquo;</p>
