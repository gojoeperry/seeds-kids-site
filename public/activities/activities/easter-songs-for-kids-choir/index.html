<p>Just as flowers bloom in spring, Jesus came alive again on Easter morning to give us new life. His love for us is so big that He chose to take away our sins and make us clean and new. When we sing Easter songs, we&rsquo;re telling this amazing story of God&rsquo;s love and celebrating that Jesus is alive!</p>
<p>Prayer: Dear Jesus, thank you for loving us so much that you died and rose again. Help us sing with joy about your resurrection. Amen.</p>
<h3 id="faqs">FAQs</h3>

<p><strong>How can I teach Easter songs to kids who don&rsquo;t read yet?</strong>
Use repetitive phrases, teach line by line, and incorporate hand motions to help with memorization. Visual aids like picture cards can also help non-readers follow along and learn the lyrics more easily.</p>
