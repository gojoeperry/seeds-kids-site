<p>Just as birds sing their beautiful songs each morning, God wants us to sing and make happy sounds for Him. When we sing about Jesus, it makes God smile, and it helps us remember how much He loves us. Jesus especially loves to hear children&rsquo;s voices praising Him. He said that praise from little ones is perfect!</p>
<p>Prayer: &ldquo;Dear Jesus, thank you for giving us happy songs to sing. Help us make joyful noises for you every day. Amen.&rdquo;</p>
