<p>Just as the shepherds and wise men came to worship baby Jesus, we can worship Him today through our songs and actions. Jesus came as a tiny baby to show us God&rsquo;s amazing love. When we sing christmas bible story songs, we&rsquo;re telling the same wonderful story that angels sang on that first Christmas night. Let&rsquo;s remember that Jesus is the greatest gift we could ever receive.</p>
<p>Prayer: &ldquo;Dear Jesus, thank you for coming as a baby to show us God&rsquo;s love. Help us worship you with joy as we sing about your birth. Amen.&rdquo;</p>
