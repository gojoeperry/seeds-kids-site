<p>Picture this: It&rsquo;s Sunday morning, and as children file into your classroom, one little girl starts humming &ldquo;Be Strong and Courageous&rdquo; under her breath. When her friend asks what she&rsquo;s singing, she confidently recites Joshua 1:9 from memory, explaining that God is always with us. This isn&rsquo;t just a sweet moment—it&rsquo;s the power of Scripture songs working exactly as God intended.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s explore a beautiful truth: when your three-year-old claps their hands while singing &ldquo;If You&rsquo;re Happy and You Know It&rdquo; at church, they&rsquo;re experiencing worship in the same way King David did when he &ldquo;danced before the Lord with all his might&rdquo; (2 Samuel 6:14). Old Sunday school songs with actions aren&rsquo;t just nostalgic entertainment—they&rsquo;re powerful tools that help children connect their whole beings to God&rsquo;s Word, creating lasting memories while building foundational faith.</p>
