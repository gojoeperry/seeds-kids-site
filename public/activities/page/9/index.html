<p>The toddler years (18 months to 3 years) represent a miraculous window for spiritual formation. During this developmental stage, children&rsquo;s brains create neural pathways at an astounding rate, making it the perfect time to introduce Scripture-based worship songs that will shape their understanding of Jesus for years to come.</p>

When families discover the power of Scripture-based Easter songs, something beautiful happens - children don&rsquo;t just learn about the resurrection; they celebrate it with their whole beings.</p>
