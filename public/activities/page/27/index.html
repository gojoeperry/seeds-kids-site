<p>Picture this: It&rsquo;s Monday morning at VBS, and children are arriving with excited anticipation. As the opening theme song begins, kids who were shy just moments before are suddenly singing with confidence, their voices joining together in worship. Have you ever wondered how the right vacation Bible school theme songs can transform a summer program from good to truly life-changing?</p>
<p>When we choose Scripture-based theme songs for VBS, we&rsquo;re doing far more than filling time or creating energy—we&rsquo;re planting seeds of biblical truth that children will carry in their hearts long after the week ends. As Psalm 96:1 reminds us, we&rsquo;re called to &ldquo;sing to the Lord a new song,&rdquo; and VBS provides the perfect opportunity to introduce children to fresh expressions of worship rooted in God&rsquo;s Word.</p>
