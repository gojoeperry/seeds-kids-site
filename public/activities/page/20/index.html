You have five days to help them encounter God&rsquo;s Word in meaningful ways, build friendships, and create memories that will last long after summer ends.

<p>Picture this: your six-year-old confidently reciting Romans 15:13 during a difficult family moment, bringing hope and comfort with words they learned through song months earlier.

<p>Sunday school Bible songs serve as powerful tools for hiding God&rsquo;s Word in young hearts, creating a foundation of biblical truth that grows stronger with each melody. Unlike entertainment-focused children&rsquo;s music, these Scripture songs transform worship time into meaningful discipleship opportunities where families sing God&rsquo;s Word together with joy and purpose.</p>
