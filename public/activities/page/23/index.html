<p>Have you ever watched a child&rsquo;s face light up when they get to stomp their feet during &ldquo;Father Abraham&rdquo; or clap their hands during &ldquo;If You&rsquo;re Happy and You Know It&rdquo;? There&rsquo;s something magical that happens when children engage their whole bodies in worship – suddenly, Scripture isn&rsquo;t just words on a page, but truth they can feel, move to, and remember long after Sunday school ends.</p>

<p>Picture this: a circle of children gathered around you, eyes bright with anticipation as you strum the opening chords to their favorite Scripture song. Their voices join yours in perfect harmony, not just singing words, but declaring God&rsquo;s truth with joy and understanding.
