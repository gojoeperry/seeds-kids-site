<p>Picture this: your seven-year-old son carefully places the baby Jesus in the nativity scene while quietly humming &ldquo;Lying in a Manger,&rdquo; his young voice carrying the wonder of Luke 2:15-16. Across the room, your four-year-old daughter rocks her doll, singing about the &ldquo;holy miracle&rdquo; of Immanuel. These aren&rsquo;t just precious family moments—they&rsquo;re evidence of God&rsquo;s Word taking root in young hearts through the power of Scripture-based Christmas music.</p>
<p>The Christmas season offers families an extraordinary opportunity to hide God&rsquo;s Word in children&rsquo;s hearts while celebrating the greatest gift ever given. When we intentionally choose Christmas songs rooted in biblical truth, we create more than holiday memories; we build lasting spiritual foundations that will guide our children throughout their lives.</p>
<h2 id="the-biblical-foundation-for-christmas-worship-music">The Biblical Foundation for Christmas Worship Music</h2>
<p>As Psalm 96:1 reminds us, we&rsquo;re called to &ldquo;sing to the Lord a new song,&rdquo; and what could be more worthy of celebration than the birth of our Savior? The Christmas story itself is filled with songs of worship—from Mary&rsquo;s magnificent praise in Luke 1:46-55 to the angelic chorus proclaiming &ldquo;Glory to God in the highest&rdquo; in Luke 2:14.</p>
<p>Colossians 3:16 encourages us to &ldquo;let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom, singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, with thankfulness in your hearts to God.&rdquo; During Christmas, this calling becomes especially powerful as children naturally enter a season of anticipation, wonder, and celebration.</p>
<p>The nativity account provides rich scriptural content that transforms abstract theological concepts into concrete, child-friendly stories. When children sing about shepherds, wise men, and baby Jesus, they&rsquo;re not just learning melodies—they&rsquo;re absorbing the foundational truths of incarnation, worship, and God&rsquo;s love for humanity.</p>
<h2 id="why-christmas-songs-matter-for-childrens-spiritual-development">Why Christmas Songs Matter for Children&rsquo;s Spiritual Development</h2>
<h3 id="cognitive-development-and-memory-formation">Cognitive Development and Memory Formation</h3>
<p>Research in child development shows that music activates multiple areas of the brain simultaneously, creating stronger neural pathways for memory retention. During the Christmas season, when children are naturally excited and engaged, their brains are primed for learning. Scripture-based Christmas songs capitalize on this heightened state, helping children memorize God&rsquo;s Word effortlessly.</p>
<p>The repetitive nature of Christmas music—songs heard year after year—creates what developmental psychologists call &ldquo;consolidation,&rdquo; where information moves from short-term to long-term memory. A five-year-old singing &ldquo;<a href="https://seedskidsworship.com/product/a-holy-miracle-matthew-123-2/">A Holy Miracle</a>&rdquo; today will likely remember both the melody and the biblical truth of Matthew 1:23 decades later.</p>
<h3 id="emotional-and-spiritual-formation">Emotional and Spiritual Formation</h3>
<p>Christmas naturally evokes wonder, anticipation, and joy in children—emotions that create ideal conditions for spiritual formation. When we pair these feelings with Scripture-based songs, we&rsquo;re helping children associate God&rsquo;s Word with positive emotions. This emotional-spiritual connection becomes a powerful foundation for lifelong faith.</p>
<p>Children also learn to process complex emotions through Christmas songs. Songs about Mary&rsquo;s courage, the shepherds&rsquo; fear and joy, or the wise men&rsquo;s long journey help children understand that faith involves various emotions and experiences—all of which God uses in His story.</p>
<h3 id="social-and-cultural-understanding">Social and Cultural Understanding</h3>
<p>Christmas songs help children understand their place in the larger story of faith. When a three-year-old sings &ldquo;<a href="https://seedskidsworship.com/product/we-still-bow-down-matthew-210-12/">We Still Bow Down</a>&rdquo; based on Matthew 2:10-12, she&rsquo;s connecting her worship with that of the wise men thousands of years ago. This creates a sense of belonging to something greater than herself—the eternal community of believers who worship Jesus as King.</p>
<h2 id="comprehensive-practical-applications-for-families">Comprehensive Practical Applications for Families</h2>
<h3 id="daily-advent-activities-with-scripture-songs">Daily Advent Activities with Scripture Songs</h3>
<p>Transform your family&rsquo;s December routine by integrating Christmas Scripture songs into daily activities. During breakfast, play &ldquo;<a href="https://seedskidsworship.com/product/god-with-us-matthew-118-24/">God With Us</a>&rdquo; based on Matthew 1:18-24, then ask your children what it means that Jesus is &ldquo;Immanuel—God with us.&rdquo; This simple practice helps children start each day remembering that God is present with them.</p>
<p>Create an &ldquo;Advent Song Calendar&rdquo; where each day features a different Christmas Scripture song paired with a brief family devotion. Monday might focus on prophecy with &ldquo;<a href="https://seedskidsworship.com/product/to-us-a-child-is-born-isaiah-96-john-316/">To Us A Child Is Born</a>&rdquo; from Isaiah 9:6, while Tuesday explores Mary&rsquo;s response with &ldquo;<a href="https://seedskidsworship.com/product/marys-song-of-praise-luke-146-50/">Mary&rsquo;s Song Of Praise</a>&rdquo; from Luke 1:46-50.</p>
<h3 id="car-ride-conversations">Car Ride Conversations</h3>
<p>Use your Christmas songs playlist to create meaningful conversations during holiday travel. When &ldquo;<a href="https://seedskidsworship.com/product/lying-in-a-manger-luke-215-16/">Lying In A Manger</a>&rdquo; plays, ask your children why they think God chose to have Jesus born in such simple circumstances. These discussions help children think critically about the Christmas story while building their biblical literacy</p>
<p>Elementary-aged children can handle more complex biblical concepts and take leadership roles in family worship. Teach them to lead family devotions using Christmas Scripture songs, explaining the biblical background and asking thoughtful questions. An eight-year-old might introduce &ldquo;<a href="https://seedskidsworship.com/product/marys-song-of-praise-luke-146-50/">Mary&rsquo;s Song Of Praise</a>&rdquo; by explaining why Mary&rsquo;s response in Luke 1:46-50 shows her faith and courage.</p>
<p>Encourage these children to research the historical and cultural context of Christmas Scripture songs. Why was it significant that Jesus was born in Bethlehem? What did the wise men&rsquo;s gifts symbolize? This research-based approach helps elementary children develop biblical literacy while deepening their understanding of Christmas truths.</p>
<h3 id="teens-and-tweens-theological-exploration-and-worship-leading">Teens and Tweens: Theological Exploration and Worship Leading</h3>
<p>Older children can explore the theological implications of Christmas Scripture songs and lead family or church worship. A teenager might prepare a family devotion on &ldquo;<a href="https://seedskidsworship.com/product/god-with-us-matthew-118-24/">God With Us</a>&rdquo; that explores the doctrine of incarnation, helping younger siblings understand how Jesus can be fully God and fully human.</p>
<p>Encourage teens to connect Christmas truths to contemporary issues. How does the message of &ldquo;<a href="https://seedskidsworship.com/product/a-holy-miracle-matthew-123-2/">A Holy Miracle</a>&rdquo; speak to our need for hope in difficult times? These applications help teenagers see that biblical truths are relevant to their daily lives.</p>
<h2 id="character-building-through-christmas-scripture-songs">Character Building Through Christmas Scripture Songs</h2>
<h3 id="developing-worship-and-reverence">Developing Worship and Reverence</h3>
<p>Christmas Scripture songs naturally teach children appropriate responses to God&rsquo;s greatness. &ldquo;<a href="https://seedskidsworship.com/product/we-still-bow-down-matthew-210-12/">We Still Bow Down</a>&rdquo; based on Matthew 2:10-12 shows children that worship is the natural response when we encounter Jesus. Regular singing of worship-focused Christmas songs helps children develop reverence not just during the holidays, but year-round.</p>
<p>Practice moments of silence after worship songs, teaching children that sometimes the most appropriate response to God&rsquo;s greatness is quiet awe. This practice develops spiritual sensitivity and helps children learn to listen for God&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<h3 id="cultivating-gratitude-and-generosity">Cultivating Gratitude and Generosity</h3>
<p>The Christmas story naturally teaches gratitude for God&rsquo;s incredible gift of Jesus. Songs like &ldquo;<a href="https://seedskidsworship.com/product/to-us-a-child-is-born-isaiah-96-john-316/">To Us A Child Is Born</a>&rdquo; help children understand that Jesus is God&rsquo;s gift to humanity, inspiring thankful hearts. Connect this gratitude to generous actions—how can our family give to others because God first gave to us?</p>
<p>Create family service projects inspired by Christmas Scripture songs. After singing about God&rsquo;s gift of Jesus, brainstorm ways to give gifts of service to neighbors, church members, or community organizations. This tangible application helps children connect biblical truth to practical action.</p>
<h3 id="building-faith-and-trust">Building Faith and Trust</h3>
<p>Mary&rsquo;s example in &ldquo;<a href="https://seedskidsworship.com/product/marys-song-of-praise-luke-146-50/">Mary&rsquo;s Song Of Praise</a>&rdquo; provides a powerful model of faith for children. Despite facing an uncertain future, Mary praised God and trusted His plan. Help children identify areas where they need to trust God, using Mary&rsquo;s example as encouragement.</p>
<p>The shepherds&rsquo; response in &ldquo;<a href="https://seedskidsworship.com/product/lying-in-a-manger-luke-215-16/">Lying In A Manger</a>&rdquo; also teaches faith—they believed the angels&rsquo; message and acted on it immediately. Discuss with children what it means to have faith that acts, not just faith that believes intellectually.</p>
<h2 id="seasonal-and-situational-usage-recommendations">Seasonal and Situational Usage Recommendations</h2>
<h3 id="early-december-building-anticipation">Early December: Building Anticipation</h3>
<p>Begin your Christmas season with prophetic songs like &ldquo;<a href="https://seedskidsworship.com/product/to-us-a-child-is-born-isaiah-96-john-316/">To Us A Child Is Born</a>&rdquo; that help children understand how God prepared for Jesus&rsquo; coming long before His birth. This builds healthy anticipation and connects the Old Testament to the New Testament in child-friendly ways.</p>
<p>Use an Advent wreath or calendar alongside these prophetic songs, helping children understand that waiting and anticipation can be forms of worship. Each week, add new Christmas Scripture songs that move chronologically through the nativity story.</p>
<h3 id="mid-december-celebrating-the-journey">Mid-December: Celebrating the Journey</h3>
<p>As Christmas approaches, incorporate songs about the characters in the Christmas story—Mary, Joseph, the shepherds, and the wise men. &ldquo;<a href="https://seedskidsworship.com/product/marys-song-of-praise-luke-146-50/">Mary&rsquo;s Song Of Praise</a>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<a href="https://seedskidsworship.com/product/we-still-bow-down-matthew-210-12/">We Still Bow Down</a>&rdquo; help children understand different responses to Jesus&rsquo; coming.</p>
<p>This is an ideal time for Christmas pageants or family nativity reenactments using these Scripture-based songs as narration and worship elements.</p>
<h3 id="christmas-week-focusing-on-the-birth">Christmas Week: Focusing on the Birth</h3>
<p>During the week of Christmas, focus intensively on the birth narrative with songs like &ldquo;<a href="https://seedskidsworship.com/product/lying-in-a-manger-luke-215-16/">Lying In A Manger</a>&rdquo;</p>
<p>This approach transforms Christmas programs from entertainment events into genuine worship experiences that honor God while showcasing what children have learned about the Christmas story.</p>
<h2 id="advanced-worship-ideas-and-creative-implementation">Advanced Worship Ideas and Creative Implementation</h2>
<h3 id="creating-christmas-worship-stations">Creating Christmas Worship Stations</h3>
<p>Transform your home or church space into worship stations inspired by Christmas Scripture songs. One station might feature a manger scene with &ldquo;<a href="https://seedskidsworship.com/product/lying-in-a-manger-luke-215-16/">Lying In A Manger</a>&rdquo; playing softly while children write prayers to baby Jesus. Another station could display gifts and gold items while &ldquo;<a href="https://seedskidsworship.com/product/we-still-bow-down-matthew-210-12/">We Still Bow Down</a>&rdquo; helps families consider what gifts they can offer to the King.</p>
<p>Include art supplies at each station so children can create visual responses to the songs—drawings, crafts, or written prayers that connect the musical experience to personal expression.</p>
<h3 id="multi-generational-learning-projects">Multi-Generational Learning Projects</h3>
<p>Partner children with grandparents or elderly church members to explore Christmas Scripture songs across generations. Older adults can share how they learned Christmas truths in their childhood while children teach them new songs like &ldquo;<a href="https://seedskidsworship.com/product/a-holy-miracle-matthew-123-2/">A Holy Miracle</a>.&rdquo; This creates meaningful relationships while showing that God&rsquo;s truth transcends generations.</p>
<p>Document these partnerships through video or written interviews, creating lasting records of how God&rsquo;s Word impacts different life stages.</p>
<h3 id="community-outreach-through-christmas-songs">Community Outreach Through Christmas Songs</h3>
<p>Use Christmas Scripture songs as bridges to your community. Organize caroling groups that sing both traditional carols and contemporary Scripture songs like &ldquo;<a href="https://seedskidsworship.com/product/god-with-us-matthew-118-24/">God With Us</a>&rdquo; in nursing homes, hospitals, or neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Prepare brief explanations of the biblical background for each song, turning caroling into gentle evangelistic opportunities where families can share the true meaning of Christmas through music and testimony.</p>
<h2 id="troubleshooting-common-family-worship-challenges">Troubleshooting Common Family Worship Challenges</h2>
<h3 id="challenge-balancing-secular-and-sacred-christmas-music">Challenge: Balancing Secular and Sacred Christmas Music</h3>
<p>Many families struggle with the balance between beloved secular Christmas songs and Scripture-based music. The solution isn&rsquo;t to eliminate all secular music, but to ensure that Scripture-based songs form the foundation of your family&rsquo;s Christmas soundtrack.</p>
<p>Create playlists that begin and end with Scripture songs, using secular songs as bridges between biblical truths. This approach allows families to enjoy the full spectrum of Christmas music while keeping God&rsquo;s Word central to their celebration.</p>
<h3 id="challenge-engaging-different-learning-styles">Challenge: Engaging Different Learning Styles</h3>
<p>Some children connect immediately with musical learning, while others need different approaches. For visual learners, create songbooks with illustrations for each Christmas Scripture song. Kinesthetic learners benefit from actions, dance, or instrument playing during songs like &ldquo;<a href="https://seedskidsworship.com/product/the-newborn-king-2/">The Newborn King</a>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For children who struggle with traditional singing, try rhythmic speaking, sign language interpretation, or artistic response during Christmas Scripture songs. The goal is hiding God&rsquo;s Word in hearts, which can happen through various methods.</p>
<h3 id="challenge-maintaining-focus-during-exciting-seasons">Challenge: Maintaining Focus During Exciting Seasons</h3>
<p>December&rsquo;s excitement can make it difficult to maintain family worship routines. Combat this by making Christmas Scripture songs part of existing routines rather than adding new obligations. Play &ldquo;<a href="https://seedskidsworship.com/product/silent-night-2/">Silent Night</a>&rdquo; during usual bedtime routines, or sing &ldquo;<a href="https://seedskidsworship.com/product/a-holy-miracle-matthew-123-2/">A Holy Miracle</a>&rdquo; during regular car trips.</p>
<p>Keep worship times shorter but more frequent during busy seasons, focusing on one Christmas Scripture song and one simple discussion question rather than lengthy devotionals.</p>
<h3 id="challenge-addressing-different-maturity-levels">Challenge: Addressing Different Maturity Levels</h3>
<p>Families with children of various ages face the challenge of keeping everyone engaged. Use Christmas Scripture songs as common ground, then provide age-appropriate follow-up activities. After singing &ldquo;<a href="https://seedskidsworship.com/product/marys-song-of-praise-luke-146-50/">Mary&rsquo;s Song Of Praise</a>,&rdquo; toddlers might rock baby dolls while teenagers research first-century Jewish culture surrounding Mary&rsquo;s response.</p>
<p>Assign older children mentorship roles with younger siblings during Christmas Scripture songs, creating natural peer teaching opportunities that benefit both age groups.</p>
<h2 id="scripture-integration-and-bible-study-connection-ideas">Scripture Integration and Bible Study Connection Ideas</h2>
<h3 id="deep-dive-scripture-studies">Deep Dive Scripture Studies</h3>
<p>Use Christmas Scripture songs as launching points for comprehensive Bible study. &ldquo;<a href="https://seedskidsworship.com/product/god-with-us-matthew-118-24/">God With Us</a>&rdquo; based on Matthew 1:18-24 can lead to studies about prophecy fulfillment, tracing the Immanuel promise from Isaiah 7:14 through its fulfillment in Jesus&rsquo; birth.</p>
<p>Create family Bible study guides that explore the historical context, original language meanings, and theological implications of passages featured in Christmas Scripture songs. This approach helps children see that songs are based on deep biblical truths worthy of extended study.</p>
<h3 id="cross-reference-exploration">Cross-Reference Exploration</h3>
<p>Help children discover how Christmas truths appear throughout Scripture by connecting Christmas songs to other biblical passages. &ldquo;<a href="https://seedskidsworship.com/product/we-still-bow-down-matthew-210-12/">We Still Bow Down</a>&rdquo; can lead to discussions about worship throughout the Bible—from Abraham&rsquo;s worship to Revelation&rsquo;s throne room scenes.</p>
<p>This cross-referencing approach helps children understan</p>
<p>Christmas Scripture songs help children develop spiritual sensitivity—the ability to recognize God&rsquo;s presence and respond appropriately. Songs like &ldquo;<a href="https://seedskidsworship.com/product/silent-night-2/">Silent Night</a>&rdquo; teach children that worship can be quiet and reflective, while &ldquo;<a href="https://seedskidsworship.com/product/we-still-bow-down-matthew-210-12/">We Still Bow Down</a>&rdquo; shows that worship can be celebratory and active.</p>
<p>This variety helps children understand that authentic spiritual life includes many emotional and worship expressions, all of which honor God when rooted in biblical truth.</p>
<h2 id="featured-scripture-songs-rich-descriptions-and-applications">Featured Scripture Songs: Rich Descriptions and Applications</h2>
<h3 id="a-holy-miracle-matthew-123"><a href="https://seedskidsworship.com/product/a-holy-miracle-matthew-123-2/">A Holy Miracle</a> (Matthew 1:23)</h3>
<p>This joyful celebration song from the 2022 &ldquo;Joyful&rdquo; album captures the wonder of Immanuel—God with us. At just over two minutes, it&rsquo;s perfect for young attention spans while delivering profound theological truth. The upbeat melody and repetitive chorus make Matthew 1:23 easily memorable for children.</p>
<p><strong>Practical Applications:</strong> Use during family devotions about God&rsquo;s promises, Christmas pageant opening numbers, or bedtime discussions about how Jesus is always with us. The song&rsquo;s celebration of God&rsquo;s presence makes it ideal for times when children feel afraid or lonely.</p>
<p><strong>Age Adaptations:</strong> Toddlers can clap and dance to the joyful rhythm, preschoolers can learn simple motions representing angels and baby Jesus, while elementary children can research the prophecy&rsquo;s fulfillment and lead family discussions about what &ldquo;Immanuel&rdquo; means in daily life.</p>
<h3 id="lying-in-a-manger-luke-21516"><a href="https://seedskidsworship.com/product/lying-in-a-manger-luke-215-16/">Lying In A Manger</a> (Luke 2:15–16)</h3>
<p>This 2:38 Christmas story song from the &ldquo;Joyful&rdquo; album brings Luke 2:15-16 to life through the shepherds&rsquo; perspective. Children connect easily with the shepherds&rsquo; excitement and urgency as they hurry to find baby Jesus exactly as the angels described.</p>
<p><strong>Scripture Integration:</strong> The song naturally leads to discussions about faith in action—the shepherds didn&rsquo;t just believe the angels&rsquo; message; they acted on it immediately. This provides excellent lessons about responsive faith for children of all ages.</p>
<p><strong>Ministry Applications:</strong> Perfect for Christmas pageants where children can act out the shepherds&rsquo; journey while singing. Also excellent for family worship times when discussing how we should respond when we learn about Jesus.</p>
<h3 id="we-still-bow-down-matthew-21012"><a href="https://seedskidsworship.com/product/we-still-bow-down-matthew-210-12/">We Still Bow Down</a> (Matthew 2:10–12)</h3>
<p>At 3:16, this is the longest song in our Christmas collection, but its worship focus makes every moment meaningful. Based on Matthew 2:10-12, it connects children&rsquo;s worship today with the wise men&rsquo;s worship thousands of years ago, creating a sense of continuity in the faith community.</p>
<p><strong>Character Building:</strong> This song excellently teaches reverence and worship responses. The wise men&rsquo;s example shows children that encountering Jesus naturally leads to worship and generous giving. Use this song to discuss how our worship and gifts honor King Jesus.</p>

<p><strong>Theological Teaching:</strong> Use this song to explore concepts of kingship and authority with children. How is Jesus different from earthly kings? What does it mean that He rules with love rather than force? These discussions help children develop biblical worldviews about leadership and power.</p>
<h3 id="silent-night-traditional"><a href="https://seedskidsworship.com/product/silent-night-2/">Silent Night</a> (Traditional)</h3>
<p>This 3:35 gentle arrangement of the beloved traditional carol provides quiet worship moments in families&rsquo; Christmas celebrations. The familiar melody allows multiple generations to participate together while the peaceful style creates space for reflection and wonder.</p>
<p><strong>Family Worship Integration:</strong> Use as transition music between more active Christmas Scripture songs, or as background during gift opening to maintain worship focus. The song&rsquo;s quiet nature makes it perfect for bedtime worship or peaceful family moments.</p>

<p>This 5:34 comprehensive Scripture song from the 2016 &ldquo;Seeds of Christmas EP&rdquo; takes families through Joseph&rsquo;s perspective of Jesus&rsquo; birth narrative. The extended length allows for deep exploration of Matthew 1:18-24, making it excellent for detailed Bible study with older children.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced Applications:</strong> Use with elementary and teenage children who can handle more complex biblical narratives. Joseph&rsquo;s example teaches obedience to God even when His plans don&rsquo;t match our expectations—powerful lessons for children facing uncertain situations.</p>
<h3 id="marys-song-of-praise">[Mary&rsquo;s Song Of Praise](<a href="https://seedskidsworship.com/product/marys">https://seedskidsworship.com/product/marys</a></h3>
<p>Multi-age families can use Christmas Scripture songs as common ground, then provide age-appropriate activities for each child. During &ldquo;<a href="https://seedskidsworship.com/product/lying-in-a-manger-luke-215-16/">Lying In A Manger</a>,&rdquo; toddlers might rock baby dolls, preschoolers can march like shepherds, elementary children can locate Bethlehem on maps, and teenagers can research first-century shepherding practices.</p>
<p>Assign older children mentorship roles with younger siblings, creating natural teaching opportunities that benefit everyone involved.</p>
<h3 id="should-i-explain-the-biblical-background-of-every-christmas-song">Should I explain the biblical background of every Christmas song?</h3>
<p>Children benefit from understanding the biblical foundation of Christmas Scripture songs, but explanations should be age-appropriate and engaging rather than lecture-like. For preschoolers, simple statements like &ldquo;This song teaches us about the shepherds who found baby Jesus&rdquo; provide sufficient context.</p>
<p>Elementary children can handle more detailed explanations about historical context, while teenagers can explore theological implications. The goal is building biblical literacy without overwhelming children with information beyond their developmental capacity.</p>

<p>December&rsquo;s packed schedules can make consistent family worship challenging. Instead of adding new obligations, integrate Christmas Scripture songs into existing routines. Play them during car trips, while decorating, or during regular meal times.</p>
<p>Keep worship moments shorter but more frequent during busy seasons. A single Christmas Scripture song with one discussion question often provides more spiritual impact than lengthy devotionals that feel burdensome during stressful times.</p>
<h3 id="can-i-use-these-songs-if-my-extended-family-doesnt-share-our-faith">Can I use these songs if my extended family doesn&rsquo;t share our faith?</h3>
<p>Christmas Scripture songs can actually provide gentle witness opportunities with extended family while maintaining your family&rsquo;s spiritual focus. Many grandparents and relatives appreciate hearing children sing beautifully, regardless of their personal faith positions.</p>
<p>Use Christmas Scripture songs during family gatherings as natural conversation starters about faith, presenting them as part of your family&rsquo;s traditions rather than confrontational statements. Often, the joy and peace evident in children who know these songs becomes powerful testimony to God&rsquo;s goodness.</p>
