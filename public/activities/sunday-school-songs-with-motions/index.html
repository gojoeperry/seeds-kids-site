<p>Picture this: your Sunday school classroom filled with children clapping, swaying, and joyfully acting out biblical truths while singing God&rsquo;s Word. Their faces light up as they march like Joshua around Jericho or spread their arms wide while singing about God&rsquo;s love. This isn&rsquo;t just entertainment—it&rsquo;s powerful, Scripture-based worship that helps children hide God&rsquo;s Word in their hearts through their whole bodies.</p>
<p>Sunday school songs with motions represent one of the most effective ways to engage children in meaningful worship while supporting their natural developmental needs. When we combine biblical truth with purposeful movement, we create memorable experiences that stick with children long after Sunday school ends.</p>
<h2 id="biblical-foundation-worship-with-our-whole-being">Biblical Foundation: Worship With Our Whole Being</h2>
<p>David knew the power of expressive worship when he wrote in Psalm 150:6, &ldquo;Let everything that has breath praise the Lord!&rdquo; This invitation to worship includes our bodies, minds, and spirits working together to glorify God. Throughout Scripture, we see examples of physical worship—David dancing before the Lord, the Israelites celebrating with tambourines and movement, and Jesus himself using physical demonstrations to teach spiritual truths.</p>
<p>Colossians 3:16 encourages us to &ldquo;teach and admonish one another with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing to God with gratitude in your hearts.&rdquo; When we add motions to these Scripture songs, we&rsquo;re following this biblical model of using music as a teaching tool while engaging children in holistic worship.</p>
<p>The book of Deuteronomy reminds us to teach God&rsquo;s Word &ldquo;when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise up&rdquo; (Deuteronomy 6:7). Motion-based worship songs naturally extend learning beyond the Sunday school hour, as children often continue singing and acting out these songs throughout their week.</p>
<h2 id="why-motion-based-scripture-songs-transform-childrens-faith">Why Motion-Based Scripture Songs Transform Children&rsquo;s Faith</h2>
<h3 id="developmental-benefits-that-support-spiritual-growth">Developmental Benefits That Support Spiritual Growth</h3>
<p>Children are naturally kinesthetic learners, meaning they understand and remember information better when their bodies are engaged. Research in child development shows that multi-sensory learning experiences create stronger neural pathways, leading to better retention and understanding. When we teach Scripture through songs with motions, we&rsquo;re working with God&rsquo;s design for how children learn best.</p>
<p><strong>Memory Formation Through Movement</strong>: The combination of rhythm, melody, and physical action creates what educators call &ldquo;embodied learning.&rdquo; Children don&rsquo;t just memorize verses—they internalize them through repeated physical and vocal practice. A child who learns <strong><a href="https://seedskidsworship.com/product/be-strong-and-courageous-joshua-19-2/">Be Strong and Courageous</a></strong> while making strong arm motions and standing tall will remember Joshua 1:9 far longer than through passive listening alone.</p>
<p><strong>Attention and Focus Enhancement</strong>: Motion naturally helps children maintain attention, especially those with high energy levels or shorter attention spans. Instead of struggling to sit still, they channel their physical energy into worship-focused activities that reinforce biblical truth.</p>
<p><strong>Emotional Connection to Scripture</strong>: Physical motions help children feel the emotions behind Scripture passages. When singing about God&rsquo;s strength, they flex their muscles. When learning about God&rsquo;s love, they stretch their arms wide. These physical expressions create emotional connections to spiritual concepts that might otherwise seem abstract.</p>
<h3 id="spiritual-formation-through-physical-expression">Spiritual Formation Through Physical Expression</h3>
<p>Motion-based worship songs serve as powerful discipleship tools that go beyond simple memorization. They help children develop a personal, embodied relationship with God&rsquo;s Word that influences their daily lives.</p>
<p><strong>Confidence in Worship</strong>: Many children feel more comfortable participating in worship when they have specific actions to perform. Shy children often bloom when they can express their faith through movement, while energetic children find appropriate outlets for their enthusiasm.</p>
<p><strong>Scripture Application</strong>: The physical motions often mirror real-life applications of biblical principles. Children learning <strong><a href="https://seedskidsworship.com/product/fear-not-isaiah-4110-2/">Fear Not</a></strong> might practice standing tall and looking ahead confidently, giving them a physical posture to remember when facing real fears.</p>
<h2 id="comprehensive-practical-applications-for-families-and-ministry">Comprehensive Practical Applications for Families and Ministry</h2>
<h3 id="sunday-school-classroom-implementation">Sunday School Classroom Implementation</h3>
<p><strong>Circle Time Integration</strong>: Begin each Sunday school session with 2-3 motion songs that relate to your lesson theme. If teaching about courage, start with <strong><a href="https://seedskidsworship.com/product/be-strong-and-courageous-joshua-19-2/">Be Strong and Courageous</a></strong>, having children march in place and make strong gestures while singing Joshua 1:9.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson Reinforcement</strong>: Use motion songs as teaching breaks during longer lessons. If discussing sin and forgiveness, pause to sing <strong><a href="https://seedskidsworship.com/product/i-will-confess-psalm-325/">I Will Confess</a></strong>, incorporating appropriate gestures for confession and celebration of forgiveness.</p>
<p><strong>Transition Management</strong>: Motion songs work excellently as transition tools between activities. A simple action song can help children refocus their energy and attention while reinforcing the day&rsquo;s Scripture memory verse.</p>
<p><strong>Review and Assessment</strong>: End lessons by having children demonstrate their learning through motion songs. Ask, &ldquo;Who can show me what it looks like to be strong and courageous?&rdquo; then lead them in the corresponding song and actions.</p>
<h3 id="home-worship-integration">Home Worship Integration</h3>
<p><strong>Morning Devotion Energizers</strong>: Start family devotions with uplifting motion songs like **[Abound In</p>
<p><strong>Recommended Approach</strong>: Use the same songs for several weeks, allowing children to master both lyrics and motions. Preschoolers love repetition and gain confidence through familiarity.</p>
<p><strong>Scripture Focus</strong>: Choose verses with concrete concepts they can understand and act out, such as God&rsquo;s love, strength, or care for them.</p>
<h3 id="elementary-ages-6-12">Elementary Ages (6-12)</h3>
<p><strong>Developmental Benefits</strong>: Elementary children can handle more complex choreography and often create their own motion variations. They enjoy songs that tell stories and include sequential movements.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced Motions</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multi-step choreography</li>
<li>Partner or group formations</li>
<li>Acting out Bible stories through movement</li>
<li>Instruments incorporated with motions</li>
<li>Sign language elements</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Learning Integration</strong>: Connect motions to other subjects like history (acting out biblical time periods) or geography (movements representing different Bible lands).</p>
<p><strong>Leadership Opportunities</strong>: Allow older elementary children to teach motions to younger children, developing their leadership skills while reinforcing their own learning.</p>
<h3 id="special-needs-considerations">Special Needs Considerations</h3>
<p><strong>Sensory Processing Support</strong>: Motion songs provide excellent sensory input for children with sensory processing differences. The combination of music, movement, and rhythm often helps these children regulate and focus.</p>
<p><strong>Adaptive Modifications</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Seated versions of standing motions</li>
<li>Simplified movements for children with motor challenges</li>
<li>Visual cues and picture cards for children with processing differences</li>
<li>Partner assistance for children needing extra support</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Inclusive Environment</strong>: Design motions that allow every child to participate meaningfully, regardless of physical abilities or developmental differences.</p>
<h2 id="character-building-through-scripture-songs-with-motions">Character Building Through Scripture Songs With Motions</h2>
<h3 id="developing-christian-virtues-through-physical-expression">Developing Christian Virtues Through Physical Expression</h3>
<p><strong>Courage and Strength</strong>: Songs like <strong><a href="https://seedskidsworship.com/product/be-strong-and-courageous-joshua-19-2/">Be Strong and Courageous</a></strong> help children embody confidence through strong postures, firm stances, and bold gestures. When facing real-life challenges, children can recall these physical expressions of courage.</p>
<p><strong>Humility and Confession</strong>: <strong><a href="https://seedskidsworship.com/product/i-will-confess-psalm-325/">I Will Confess</a></strong> teaches appropriate physical expressions of humility—bowed heads, open hands, and gentle gestures that help children understand the heart attitude behind confession.</p>
<p><strong>Joy and Celebration</strong>: Uplifting songs with celebratory motions teach children that worship includes joy and excitement about God&rsquo;s goodness. These experiences shape their understanding of Christianity as life-giving rather than restrictive.</p>
<p><strong>Wisdom and Thoughtfulness</strong>: Songs about seeking God&rsquo;s wisdom, like <strong><a href="https://seedskidsworship.com/product/let-him-ask-god-james-15/">Let Him Ask God</a></strong>, can include thoughtful gestures—hands folded in prayer, finger to temple indicating thinking, and open hands ready to receive God&rsquo;s guidance.</p>
<h3 id="building-worship-habits-and-heart-attitudes">Building Worship Habits and Heart Attitudes</h3>
<p><strong>Reverence and Respect</strong>: Teaching appropriate physical expressions of worship—bowed heads during prayer motions, respectful postures during quiet songs—helps children develop reverent hearts toward God.</p>
<p><strong>Community and Unity</strong>: Group motions teach children about worship as a community activity. They learn to move together, follow leaders, and participate in corporate expressions of faith.</p>
<p><strong>Personal Expression</strong>: While maintaining appropriate structure, motion songs also allow children space for personal worship expression, helping them develop their individual relationship with God.</p>
<h2 id="seasonal-and-situational-applications">Seasonal and Situational Applications</h2>
<h3 id="holiday-and-special-season-integration">Holiday and Special Season Integration</h3>
<p><strong>Christmas Celebrations</strong>: Use motion songs that tell the nativity story, allowing children to act out the journey to Bethlehem, angels announcing Christ&rsquo;s birth, and shepherds worshiping the newborn king.</p>
<p><strong>Easter Worship</strong>: Resurrection-themed songs with victory motions—arms raised high, celebratory movements, and joyful expressions—help children understand the triumph of Christ over sin and death.</p>
<p><strong>Thanksgiving Expressions</strong>: Gratitude-focused motion songs teach children to express thankfulness through their bodies—hands over hearts, arms raised in praise, and gestures of giving thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Back-to-School Transitions</strong>: Use Scripture songs about wisdom and learning to help children approach new school years with biblical perspective and confidence.</p>
<h3 id="challenging-life-situations">Challenging Life Situations</h3>
<p><strong>Fear and Anxiety</strong>: When children face fears—new schools, family changes, or world events—songs like <strong><a href="https://seedskidsworship.com/product/fear-not-isaiah-4110-2/">Fear Not</a></strong> provide both truth and physical exercises that combat anxiety with God&rsquo;s promises.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline and Correction</strong>: Songs about confession and forgiveness help children process mistakes and discipline situations with biblical understanding and hope for restoration.</p>
<p><strong>Peer Pressure and Choices</strong>: Motion songs about wisdom and following God&rsquo;s ways give children physical practices for standing strong in difficult social situations.</p>
<h2 id="featured-scripture-songs-that-transform-sunday-school">Featured Scripture Songs That Transform Sunday School</h2>
<h3 id="songs-for-building-faith-foundations">Songs for Building Faith Foundations</h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://seedskidsworship.com/product/all-have-sinned-romans-323-623-2/">All Have Sinned</a></strong> creates powerful teaching moments about humanity&rsquo;s need for salvation. Simple motions can represent the universality of sin (everyone pointing to themselves) and the gift of eternal life (hands open to receive). This gospel-centered song from Romans 3:23 &amp; 6:23 provides essential theological foundation with age-appropriate music and movement.</p>
<p>**[If We Confess](https://seedsk</p>
<p><strong>Theme Reinforcement</strong>: Motion songs powerfully reinforce VBS themes throughout each day. Children carry Scripture and themes with them as they sing and move together during transitions, snack time, and closing celebrations.</p>
<p><strong>Performance Opportunities</strong>: Consider simple motion song presentations for parents and congregation members. These aren&rsquo;t entertainment but worship demonstrations that showcase children&rsquo;s Scripture learning.</p>
<p><strong>Community Outreach</strong>: Motion-based Scripture songs work wonderfully for community events, park programs, and outreach activities where you want to engage children and families with the gospel.</p>
<h3 id="childrens-church-integration">Children&rsquo;s Church Integration</h3>
<p><strong>Attention Management</strong>: Use strategic motion songs to help children refocus during children&rsquo;s church services. A well-placed action song can redirect wandering attention back to worship and learning.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson Application</strong>: End children&rsquo;s church lessons with motion songs that reinforce the day&rsquo;s biblical teaching. Children leave with Scripture physically and mentally embedded through song and movement.</p>
<h2 id="advanced-worship-ideas-and-creative-implementation">Advanced Worship Ideas and Creative Implementation</h2>
<h3 id="multi-sensory-worship-experiences">Multi-Sensory Worship Experiences</h3>
<p><strong>Instrument Integration</strong>: Add simple rhythm instruments to motion songs. Tambourines, shakers, and rhythm sticks enhance the worship experience while developing musical skills and coordination.</p>
<p><strong>Visual Enhancement</strong>: Use colorful scarves, ribbons, or flags during motion songs to create beautiful visual worship expressions. These props help children focus on the worship aspect while adding meaningful beauty to their movements.</p>
<p><strong>Seasonal Decorations</strong>: Incorporate seasonal elements into motion songs—falling leaves during autumn gratitude songs, flowers during spring creation themes, or stars during Christmas celebrations.</p>
<h3 id="technology-integration">Technology Integration</h3>
<p><strong>Video Learning</strong>: Create simple video demonstrations of motion songs for families to use at home. Children learn better when they can practice with visual guides.</p>
<p><strong>Projection Support</strong>: Display song lyrics and motion cues on screens to help children and leaders participate fully without holding songbooks.</p>
<p><strong>Recording Worship</strong>: Consider recording children&rsquo;s motion song worship for shut-in church members or family members who live far away. These recordings become precious gifts that spread joy and share Scripture.</p>
<h3 id="creative-choreography-development">Creative Choreography Development</h3>
<p><strong>Child-Led Creation</strong>: Allow children to create their own motions for familiar Scripture songs. Their natural creativity often produces meaningful movements that resonate with their peers.</p>
<p><strong>Story-Based Choreography</strong>: Develop sequential movements that tell complete Bible stories through song and dance. These become powerful teaching tools that help children remember narrative details.</p>
<p><strong>Partner and Group Formations</strong>: Create simple partner movements or group formations that teach cooperation and unity while maintaining focus on Scripture content.</p>
<h2 id="troubleshooting-common-family-worship-challenges">Troubleshooting Common Family Worship Challenges</h2>
<h3 id="overcoming-initial-resistance">Overcoming Initial Resistance</h3>
<p><strong>Adult Self-Consciousness</strong>: Many parents feel awkward leading motion songs, especially if they don&rsquo;t consider themselves &ldquo;musical&rdquo; or &ldquo;coordinated.&rdquo; Start with simple, repetitive motions and remember that enthusiasm matters more than perfection. Children respond to genuine participation rather than polished performance.</p>
<p><strong>Teenage Embarrassment</strong>: Older children sometimes resist &ldquo;childish&rdquo; activities. Address this by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Giving them leadership roles with younger siblings</li>
<li>Choosing songs with more sophisticated choreography</li>
<li>Emphasizing the biblical truth rather than the &ldquo;fun&rdquo; aspects</li>
<li>Allowing them to adapt motions to their comfort level</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Space Limitations</strong>: Not every family has large living spaces for motion songs. Adapt by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Focusing on upper body movements while seated</li>
<li>Taking worship outside when weather permits</li>
<li>Using smaller, more controlled motions</li>
<li>Emphasizing the heart attitude over large movements</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="managing-different-age-groups">Managing Different Age Groups</h3>
<p><strong>Mixed-Age Challenges</strong>: When families include wide age ranges, choose songs with simple basic motions that allow for individual elaboration. Older children can add complexity while younger ones do simplified versions.</p>
<p><strong>Attention Span Variations</strong>: Keep motion song segments appropriate for your youngest participants. Three to five minutes works well for most mixed-age situations, with longer sessions possible for older children.</p>
<p><strong>Competition and Comparison</strong>: Focus on worship rather than performance. Regularly remind children that God loves their honest praise regardless of their coordination or ability to remember all the motions.</p>
<h3 id="creating-sustainable-routines">Creating Sustainable Routines</h3>
<p><strong>Consistency Challenges</strong>: Establish realistic expectations for family worship. Even five minutes of motion-based Scripture songs twice weekly creates meaningful patterns and learning opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>Energy Management</strong>: Use motion songs strategically—energetic songs for morning devotions or when children need to refocus, calmer songs for evening wind-down or quiet reflection times.</p>
<p><strong>Motivation Maintenance</strong>: Rotate songs regularly to maintain interest while keeping some familiar favorites. Children need both novelty and security in their worship experiences.</p>
<h2 id="scripture-integration-and-bible-study-connections">Scripture Integration and Bible Study Connections</h2>
<h3 id="connecting-songs-to-family-devotions">Connecting Songs to Family Devotions</h3>
<p><strong>Verse Memorization</strong>: Use motion songs as the foundation for family Scripture memory programs. The combination of music and movement makes memorization enjoyable and effective.</p>
<p><strong>Topical Studies</strong>: When your family studies biblical topics—fear, obedience, love, forgiveness—incorporate related motion songs to reinforce learning and provide application opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>Character Studies</strong>: Learning about biblical heroes? Add motion songs that highlight their key characteristics or experiences. Singing about Joshua&rsquo;s courage while marching around your living room brings the story to life.</p>
<h3 id="prayer-and-worship-integration">Prayer and Worship Integration</h3>
<p><strong>Prayer Preparation</strong>: Begin family prayer time with motion songs that focus hearts on God&rsquo;s character and presence. This helps children transition from daily activities to meaningful prayer.</p>
<p><strong>Gratitude Expressions</strong>: Use thankfulness-themed motion songs during family gratitude practices. Physical expressions of thanks help children develop grateful hearts and attitudes.</p>
<p><strong>Scripture Meditation</strong>: After learning motion songs, spend time discussing the</p>
<p><strong>Retention and Recall</strong>: The multi-sensory nature of motion songs creates what educators call &ldquo;elaborative encoding&rdquo;—multiple memory pathways that make information easier to recall. Children who learn Scripture through song and movement often remember verses years later.</p>
<h3 id="developmental-stage-considerations">Developmental Stage Considerations</h3>
<p><strong>Preschool Development</strong>: Ages 3-5 are developing gross motor skills, language abilities, and beginning abstract thinking. Motion songs support all these areas while introducing foundational biblical concepts in concrete, understandable ways.</p>
<p><strong>Elementary Growth</strong>: School-age children (6-12) can handle more complex choreography and deeper theological concepts. They benefit from motion songs that challenge their growing abilities while reinforcing academic learning and spiritual development.</p>
<p><strong>Social Development</strong>: Group motion songs teach cooperation, following instructions, and appropriate social interaction within spiritual contexts. Children learn to worship as community members rather than isolated individuals.</p>
<h3 id="supporting-different-temperaments-and-personalities">Supporting Different Temperaments and Personalities</h3>
<p><strong>High-Energy Children</strong>: Motion songs provide appropriate outlets for physical energy while channeling it toward spiritual purposes. These children often become enthusiastic worship leaders when given positive direction.</p>
<p><strong>Quiet or Shy Children</strong>: Structured motions can help reserved children participate more fully in worship without requiring verbal expression or spontaneous creativity. They often blossom when they know exactly what&rsquo;s expected.</p>
<p><strong>Analytical Children</strong>: These children appreciate understanding the biblical basis for songs and may enjoy learning about the historical contexts of Scripture verses being sung.</p>
<h2 id="song-selection-and-comparison-guidance">Song Selection and Comparison Guidance</h2>
<h3 id="choosing-appropriate-songs-for-your-context">Choosing Appropriate Songs for Your Context</h3>
<p><strong>Theological Accuracy</strong>: Always verify that motion songs accurately represent biblical truth. Seeds Kids Worship songs excel in this area, with each song rooted in specific Scripture passages and maintaining biblical integrity.</p>
<p><strong>Age Appropriateness</strong>: Consider both the theological complexity and physical demands of songs. While <strong><a href="https://seedskidsworship.com/product/all-have-sinned-romans-323-623-2/">All Have Sinned</a></strong> addresses crucial gospel truth, it requires mature explanation for younger children.</p>
<p><strong>Cultural Sensitivity</strong>: Choose songs and motions that work well within your family or church culture. Some communities prefer more reserved expressions while others embrace highly energetic worship.</p>
<h3 id="balancing-different-types-of-scripture-songs">Balancing Different Types of Scripture Songs</h3>
<p><strong>Doctrinal Foundation Songs</strong>: Include songs that teach essential Christian beliefs—salvation, God&rsquo;s character, Scripture authority, and Christian living. These form the theological foundation for children&rsquo;s faith development.</p>
<p><strong>Practical Application Songs</strong>: Balance theological songs with practical ones like <strong><a href="https://seedskidsworship.com/product/let-him-ask-god-james-15/">Let Him Ask God</a></strong> that give children specific guidance for daily situations and decisions.</p>
<p><strong>Worship and Praise</strong>: Include songs focused purely on praising God&rsquo;s character and celebrating His goodness. <strong><a href="https://seedskidsworship.com/product/abound-in-hope-romans-1513/">Abound In Hope</a></strong> provides joyful worship expression that builds children&rsquo;s enthusiasm for praise.</p>
<p><strong>Narrative Songs</strong>: Biblical story songs like <strong><a href="https://seedskidsworship.com/product/i-am-with-you/">Babel</a></strong> help children learn Bible history while understanding God&rsquo;s character and ways.</p>
<h3 id="quality-indicators-for-motion-based-scripture-songs">Quality Indicators for Motion-Based Scripture Songs</h3>
<p><strong>Biblical Fidelity</strong>: The best songs quote Scripture directly or closely paraphrase biblical passages. Each Seeds Kids Worship song identifies its specific Scripture foundation, ensuring theological accuracy.</p>
<p><strong>Memorable Melodies</strong>: Effective Scripture songs have singable melodies that stick in children&rsquo;s minds without being overly complex or repetitive to the point of annoyance.</p>
<p><strong>Appropriate Motion Potential</strong>: Look for songs with natural rhythm and lyrical content that lends itself to meaningful physical expression. Avoid songs that require forced or inappropriate movements.</p>
<p><strong>Spiritual Depth</strong>: Quality Scripture songs contain genuine theological content rather than generic &ldquo;God is good&rdquo; messages. They should teach specific biblical truths and principles.</p>
<h2 id="comprehensive-faq-sunday-school-songs-with-motions">Comprehensive FAQ: Sunday School Songs With Motions</h2>
<p><strong>Q: How young can children start learning motion songs?</strong>
A: Toddlers as young as 18 months can begin simple motions like clapping and swaying, though they won&rsquo;t master complex movements until ages 3-4. Start with basic movements and simple melodies, gradually increasing complexity as children develop.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What if children don&rsquo;t want to do the motions?</strong>
A: Never force participation, but gently encourage involvement. Sometimes children prefer to watch initially before joining. Offer alternatives like clapping or simple swaying for children uncomfortable with complex movements. Focus on heart attitude rather than perfect participation.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How do I teach motions to children who&rsquo;ve never done them before?</strong>
A: Start slowly with simple, repetitive songs. Break down movements into small parts, demonstrate clearly, and practice without music first. Use positive encouragement and remember that children learn at different paces.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can motion songs work for children with special needs?</strong>
A: Absolutely! Motion songs are often excellent for special needs children, providing sensory input and structure that helps with regulation and learning. Adapt movements as needed—seated versions, simplified motions, or partner assistance all work well.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How often should we use motion songs in Sunday school?</strong>
A: Most effective programs include 2-3 motion songs per session—one for opening worship, one during lesson time, and one for closing. Adjust based on your time constraints and children&rsquo;s attention spans.</p>
<p>**Q: What&rsquo;s the difference between entertainment an</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can teenagers benefit from motion songs, or are they too old?</strong>
A: Many teenagers enjoy motion songs when given leadership roles, more sophisticated choreography, or worship team participation. Focus on the spiritual benefits and Scripture learning rather than childish &ldquo;fun.&rdquo; Some may prefer instrument accompaniment to movement.</p>
