<h2 id="discovering-the-heart-of-christmas-through-scripture-songs">Discovering the Heart of Christmas Through Scripture Songs</h2>
<p>Picture this: your children&rsquo;s faces lighting up not just from twinkling Christmas lights, but from the deep joy of understanding that Jesus came as Immanuel—God with us. Christmas kids devotional songs create these precious moments where holiday celebration meets spiritual formation, helping families navigate the beautiful balance between festive traditions and faith-centered worship.</p>
<p>When we intentionally choose devotional Christmas music for our children, we&rsquo;re doing far more than adding background music to our holiday season. We&rsquo;re creating opportunities for young hearts to encounter the profound truths of the nativity story while building lasting memories rooted in God&rsquo;s Word.</p>
<h2 id="biblical-foundation-for-christmas-worship">Biblical Foundation for Christmas Worship</h2>
<p>Scripture calls us to celebrate God&rsquo;s greatest gift with songs of praise. As Psalm 96:1-3 declares, &ldquo;Sing to the Lord a new song; sing to the Lord, all the earth. Sing to the Lord, praise his name; proclaim his salvation day after day. Declare his glory among the nations, his marvelous deeds among all peoples.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The birth of Jesus represents the ultimate &ldquo;marvelous deed&rdquo;—God becoming flesh to dwell among us. When children sing about this miraculous truth, they&rsquo;re participating in the same kind of worship the angels offered that first Christmas night. Luke 2:13-14 shows us that the very announcement of Jesus&rsquo; birth came through song: &ldquo;Suddenly a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel, praising God and saying, &lsquo;Glory to God in the highest heaven, and on earth peace to those on whom his favor rests.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colossians 3:16 reminds us to &ldquo;let the message of Christ dwell among you richly as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom through psalms, hymns, and songs from the Spirit.&rdquo; Christmas devotional songs become a powerful way to let Christ&rsquo;s message—His incarnation, His mission, His love—dwell richly in our children&rsquo;s hearts throughout the entire holiday season.</p>
<h2 id="why-christmas-devotional-songs-matter-for-childrens-faith-development">Why Christmas Devotional Songs Matter for Children&rsquo;s Faith Development</h2>
<h3 id="theological-understanding-through-melody">Theological Understanding Through Melody</h3>
<p>Children&rsquo;s brains are uniquely wired to process and retain information through music. When we combine the profound theological truths of Christmas with engaging melodies, we&rsquo;re utilizing this natural learning pathway to help children grasp concepts that might otherwise seem abstract or overwhelming.</p>
<p>The incarnation—God becoming human—is a complex theological concept, yet when children sing about baby Jesus lying in a manger, they begin to understand that this tiny baby was actually God Himself coming to earth. <strong><a href="https://seedskidsworship.com/product/lying-in-a-manger-luke-215-16/">Lying In A Manger</a></strong> from Luke 2:15-16 helps children visualize this scene while internalizing the Scripture passage that describes the shepherds&rsquo; discovery of the Christ child.</p>
<h3 id="emotional-connection-to-spiritual-truth">Emotional Connection to Spiritual Truth</h3>
<p>Christmas naturally evokes wonder and excitement in children. Devotional Christmas songs harness this emotional openness to create deeper spiritual connections. When a child sings about the wise men&rsquo;s worship in <strong><a href="https://seedskidsworship.com/product/we-still-bow-down-matthew-210-12/">We Still Bow Down</a></strong>, they&rsquo;re not just learning about historical events—they&rsquo;re discovering that worship is the appropriate response to encountering Jesus, just as relevant today as it was 2,000 years ago.</p>
<h3 id="building-anticipation-and-understanding">Building Anticipation and Understanding</h3>
<p>Christmas devotional songs help children understand that Jesus&rsquo; birth was both the fulfillment of ancient promises and the beginning of God&rsquo;s redemptive plan. Songs like <strong><a href="https://seedskidsworship.com/product/to-us-a-child-is-born-isaiah-96-john-316/">To Us A Child Is Born</a></strong> connect Isaiah&rsquo;s prophecy with John 3:16, helping children see how Christmas fits into the larger story of God&rsquo;s love for humanity.</p>
<h2 id="comprehensive-practical-applications-for-family-christmas-worship">Comprehensive Practical Applications for Family Christmas Worship</h2>
<h3 id="daily-advent-devotional-integration">Daily Advent Devotional Integration</h3>
<p>Transform your family&rsquo;s Advent season by incorporating devotional Christmas songs into daily worship times. Create a simple routine where each morning begins with lighting an Advent candle and singing a Scripture-based Christmas song. This practice helps children anticipate Christmas while building spiritual discipline.</p>
<p>Start December 1st with gentle songs about anticipation and God&rsquo;s promises. <strong><a href="https://seedskidsworship.com/product/a-holy-miracle-matthew-123-2/">A Holy Miracle</a></strong> celebrating Matthew 1:23 works beautifully as families discuss how God fulfilled His promise to send a Savior. Progress through the month with songs that tell the Christmas story chronologically, culminating in celebration songs on Christmas morning.</p>
<h3 id="christmas-morning-worship-tradition">Christmas Morning Worship Tradition</h3>
<p>Establish a Christmas morning tradition that begins before gift-opening with family worship time. Gather around your Christmas tree or nativity scene and sing <strong><a href="https://seedskidsworship.com/product/the-newborn-king-2/">The Newborn King</a></strong> to center your family&rsquo;s attention on Jesus before the excitement of presents takes over. This practice teaches children that Christmas celebration should begin with worship of the One whose birthday we&rsquo;re celebrating.</p>
<h3 id="holiday-meal-blessings">Holiday Meal Blessings</h3>
<p>Extend traditional meal prayers during Christmas gatherings by incorporating brief Christmas devotional songs. **[Mary&rsquo;s Song Of Praise](https://seedskidsw</p>
<p>Create simple Christmas story books where each page corresponds to a different devotional song. Children can illustrate scenes while listening to the songs, reinforcing both the biblical narrative and the Scripture passages embedded in the music.</p>
<h3 id="upper-elementary-ages-9-12-theological-depth">Upper Elementary (Ages 9-12): Theological Depth</h3>
<p>Older elementary children can grasp more complex theological concepts like prophecy fulfillment and the significance of Jesus&rsquo; dual nature as both God and human. <strong><a href="https://seedskidsworship.com/product/to-us-a-child-is-born-isaiah-96-john-316/">To Us A Child Is Born</a></strong> connecting Isaiah 9:6 with John 3:16 helps them understand how Jesus&rsquo; birth fulfilled Old Testament prophecies while demonstrating God&rsquo;s love.</p>
<p>Encourage these children to look up the Scripture passages referenced in Christmas devotional songs and discuss how the lyrics accurately reflect biblical truth. This builds both Bible study skills and discernment about music choices.</p>
<h2 id="character-building-through-christmas-scripture-songs">Character Building Through Christmas Scripture Songs</h2>
<h3 id="developing-worship-hearts">Developing Worship Hearts</h3>
<p>Christmas devotional songs naturally cultivate worshipful hearts in children. When they sing about the wise men&rsquo;s response to finding Jesus in <strong><a href="https://seedskidsworship.com/product/we-still-bow-down-matthew-210-12/">We Still Bow Down</a></strong>, children learn that worship is the appropriate response to encountering Jesus—not just during Christmas, but throughout their lives.</p>
<p>Regular exposure to worship-focused Christmas songs during the holiday season creates positive associations between celebration and worship. Children begin to understand that our greatest joys should lead us to praise God, building a foundation for lifelong worship.</p>
<h3 id="cultivating-gratitude-and-wonder">Cultivating Gratitude and Wonder</h3>
<p>The miracle of the incarnation—God becoming human—naturally evokes wonder and gratitude. <strong><a href="https://seedskidsworship.com/product/a-holy-miracle-matthew-123-2/">A Holy Miracle</a></strong> helps children approach Jesus&rsquo; birth with appropriate awe while building thankful hearts for God&rsquo;s incredible gift of salvation.</p>
<p>Songs about Mary&rsquo;s response, like <strong><a href="https://seedskidsworship.com/product/marys-song-of-praise-luke-146-50/">Mary&rsquo;s Song Of Praise</a></strong>, demonstrate how believers should respond to God&rsquo;s goodness with grateful praise. Children learn that gratitude isn&rsquo;t just good manners—it&rsquo;s a biblical response to recognizing God&rsquo;s blessings.</p>
<h3 id="building-faith-and-trust">Building Faith and Trust</h3>
<p>The Christmas story demonstrates God&rsquo;s faithfulness to His promises. When children sing about how Jesus&rsquo; birth fulfilled ancient prophecies, they build confidence that God keeps His word. This foundation of trust becomes crucial as children face challenges and need to rely on God&rsquo;s promises throughout their lives.</p>
<h2 id="seasonal-and-situational-applications">Seasonal and Situational Applications</h2>
<h3 id="advent-season-preparation">Advent Season Preparation</h3>
<p>Begin your family&rsquo;s Christmas season preparation in late November with gentle songs about anticipation and God&rsquo;s promises. This helps children understand that Christmas celebration should build gradually, focused on preparing hearts to worship Jesus rather than simply counting down to presents.</p>
<p>Create an Advent playlist featuring devotional Christmas songs that progress through the Christmas story chronologically. Week one might focus on Old Testament prophecies, week two on the announcement to Mary, week three on Jesus&rsquo; birth, and week four on the wise men&rsquo;s worship.</p>
<h3 id="christmas-eve-and-christmas-day-worship">Christmas Eve and Christmas Day Worship</h3>
<p>Christmas Eve provides a natural opportunity for quiet, reflective worship before the excitement of Christmas morning. <strong><a href="https://seedskidsworship.com/product/silent-night-2/">Silent Night</a></strong> arranged for children creates a peaceful atmosphere for family prayer and reflection on the significance of Jesus&rsquo; birth.</p>
<p>Christmas morning worship sets the tone for the entire day. Begin with celebration songs like <strong><a href="https://seedskidsworship.com/product/the-newborn-king-2/">The Newborn King</a></strong> before opening gifts, establishing that Christmas joy flows from Jesus&rsquo; birth rather than material presents.</p>
<h3 id="post-christmas-reflection">Post-Christmas Reflection</h3>
<p>The week between Christmas and New Year&rsquo;s offers valuable opportunities for reflection and application. Use this time to help children think about how the truths they&rsquo;ve been singing should impact their lives in the coming year. Songs about Jesus being &ldquo;God with us&rdquo; help children understand that Jesus&rsquo; presence isn&rsquo;t limited to Christmas—He&rsquo;s with them every day.</p>
<h3 id="dealing-with-christmas-overwhelm">Dealing with Christmas Overwhelm</h3>
<p>The Christmas season can become overwhelming for children, especially those who are sensitive or struggle with change. Devotional Christmas songs provide calming, centering moments throughout busy holiday schedules. Keep a collection of peaceful Christmas worship songs available for times when children need to reset and refocus on Jesus rather than holiday chaos.</p>
<h2 id="ministry-and-church-applications">Ministry and Church Applications</h2>
<h3 id="sunday-school-and-childrens-church-integration">Sunday School and Children&rsquo;s Church Integration</h3>
<p>Christmas devotional songs work beautifully in church settings, providing Scripture-based alternatives to purely entertainment-focused Christmas music. <strong><a href="https://seedskidsworship.com/product/lying-in-a-manger-luke-215-16/">Lying In A Manger</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://seedskidsworship.com/product/we-still-bow-down-matthew-210-12/">We Still Bow Down</a></strong> help children learn specific Bible passages while participating in corporate worship.</p>
<p>Create lesson plans that build around the Scripture passages embedded in these songs. Children can read the Bible verses, discuss their meaning, and then reinforce the truth through music that makes the passages memorable.</p>
<h3 id="christmas-pageant-and-program-applications">Christmas Pageant and Program Applications</h3>
<p>Instead of focusing solely on cute factor, use Christmas programs as discipleship opportunities. Choose devotional songs that teach biblical truth while still creating beautiful performances for</p>
<p>Prepare children for caroling by discussing how their singing can be a form of ministry, sharing the good news of Jesus&rsquo; birth with neighbors who might not otherwise hear the biblical Christmas story.</p>
<h3 id="multi-generational-worship-planning">Multi-Generational Worship Planning</h3>
<p>Involve grandparents and older church members in teaching children about Christmas traditions that focus on worship and Scripture. Many older adults remember when Christmas celebrations were more centered on Jesus and can share stories that complement the truths found in devotional Christmas songs.</p>
<p>Create intergenerational worship services where different age groups contribute to Christmas celebration through Scripture-based songs, readings, and testimonies about how Christmas has deepened their faith over the years.</p>
<h2 id="scripture-integration-and-bible-study-connections">Scripture Integration and Bible Study Connections</h2>
<h3 id="connecting-songs-to-bible-reading-plans">Connecting Songs to Bible Reading Plans</h3>
<p>Develop family Bible reading plans that correspond to your Christmas devotional songs. When children sing <strong><a href="https://seedskidsworship.com/product/god-with-us-matthew-118-24/">God With Us</a></strong> based on Matthew 1:18-24, follow up by reading the complete passage together and discussing questions like: &ldquo;Why was it important for Jesus to be born of a virgin?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What does it mean that Jesus is &lsquo;God with us&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This approach helps children understand that Christian songs should always be rooted in biblical truth, building discernment skills they&rsquo;ll need as they encounter various types of music throughout their lives.</p>
<h3 id="memorization-through-music">Memorization Through Music</h3>
<p>Use Christmas devotional songs as Scripture memory tools by focusing on the biblical passages that inspired each song. <strong><a href="https://seedskidsworship.com/product/a-holy-miracle-matthew-123-2/">A Holy Miracle</a></strong> helps children memorize Matthew 1:23, while <strong><a href="https://seedskidsworship.com/product/marys-song-of-praise-luke-146-50/">Mary&rsquo;s Song of Praise</a></strong> reinforces Luke 1:46-50.</p>
<p>Create memory verse challenges where children earn small rewards for reciting the Bible passages connected to their favorite Christmas songs. This builds both Scripture knowledge and positive associations with biblical truth.</p>
<h3 id="cross-reference-study-skills">Cross-Reference Study Skills</h3>
<p>Teach older children to use study Bibles or Bible apps to explore cross-references related to the Scripture passages in their Christmas songs. When singing about Jesus as the promised child from Isaiah 9:6, help them discover other Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah&rsquo;s birth and how Jesus fulfilled each one.</p>
<p>This practice builds valuable Bible study skills while deepening children&rsquo;s understanding of how Jesus&rsquo; birth fits into God&rsquo;s larger redemptive plan throughout history.</p>
<h2 id="addressing-common-family-worship-challenges">Addressing Common Family Worship Challenges</h2>
<h3 id="managing-different-faith-levels-within-families">Managing Different Faith Levels Within Families</h3>
<p>Many families include members with varying levels of faith commitment. Christmas devotional songs often provide neutral ground where everyone can participate in beautiful music while those who are believers find deeper spiritual meaning. <strong><a href="https://seedskidsworship.com/product/silent-night-2/">Silent Night</a></strong> appeals to cultural Christmas tradition while maintaining clear focus on Jesus&rsquo; birth and significance.</p>
<p>Start with widely accepted Christmas songs that have clear biblical content, gradually introducing more explicitly worship-focused songs as family members become more comfortable with faith-centered Christmas celebration.</p>
<h3 id="competing-with-secular-christmas-music">Competing with Secular Christmas Music</h3>
<p>Children are constantly exposed to secular Christmas music that focuses on Santa, reindeer, and material gifts. Combat this influence by making devotional Christmas songs more appealing through enthusiastic family participation, special Christmas music listening times, and positive associations with fun family activities.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t simply ban secular Christmas music—instead, help children understand the difference between songs that celebrate cultural Christmas traditions and songs that worship Jesus. This builds discernment skills while maintaining family harmony during holiday gatherings with extended family and friends.</p>
<h3 id="maintaining-focus-during-busy-holiday-schedules">Maintaining Focus During Busy Holiday Schedules</h3>
<p>December schedules can become overwhelming, making consistent family worship challenging. Prepare by creating flexible worship routines that can adapt to busy days. Keep a playlist of shorter Christmas devotional songs available for car rides, meal preparations, or bedtime routines when longer worship times aren&rsquo;t possible.</p>
<p>Remember that consistency matters more than duration. Five minutes of focused Christmas worship daily builds stronger spiritual foundations than occasional longer sessions that happen sporadically due to scheduling conflicts.</p>
<h3 id="engaging-different-learning-styles">Engaging Different Learning Styles</h3>
<p>Children learn and process information differently. Visual learners benefit from Christmas books that illustrate the scenes described in devotional songs. Kinesthetic learners need physical movements and actions that correspond to song lyrics. Auditory learners thrive with repeated listening and discussion about the biblical truths embedded in the music.</p>
<p>Create multi-sensory Christmas worship experiences that incorporate various learning styles. Set up nativity scenes that children can manipulate while singing, provide art supplies for illustrating favorite Christmas songs, or encourage dramatic play that acts out the Christmas story while music plays in the background.</p>
<h2 id="parent-education-child-development-and-christmas-music">Parent Education: Child Development and Christmas Music</h2>
<h3 id="understanding-spiritual-development-stages">Understanding Spiritual Development Stages</h3>
<p>Children&rsquo;s spiritual development progresses through predictable stages, and Christmas devotional songs can support growth at each level. Preschoolers focus on concrete concepts and need songs with simple, literal truths about Jesus being a baby, growing up, and loving children. Elementary-age children can grasp more abstract concepts like Jesus being both God and human, making songs like <strong><a href="https://seedskidsworship.com/product/a-holy-miracle-matthew-123-2/">A Holy Miracle</a></strong> about the incarnation more meaningful.</p>
<p>Pre-teens begin questioning and need songs that address deeper theological concepts while maintaining emotional appeal. **[We Still Bow Down](<a href="https://seedskidsworship.com/product/">https://seedskidsworship.com/product/</a></p>
<p>Establish an annual tradition where your family prepares a Christmas concert featuring devotional songs for grandparents, neighbors, or church family. This tradition gives children goals to work toward while building performance skills and confidence in sharing their faith through music.</p>
<p>Start simple with just two or three songs, adding complexity as children grow older and more skilled. Focus on clear pronunciation of lyrics so audiences can understand the biblical truths being shared, rather than just enjoying cute performances.</p>
<h3 id="christmas-music-advent-calendars">Christmas Music Advent Calendars</h3>
<p>Create advent calendars that introduce new Christmas devotional songs each day rather than focusing on treats or small gifts. This approach helps children anticipate Christmas through growing familiarity with the biblical story while building a repertoire of Scripture-based songs.</p>
<p>Include brief explanations of the Bible verses connected to each song, turning daily music discovery into mini Bible study sessions that build both musical and theological knowledge throughout December.</p>
<h3 id="generational-music-sharing">Generational Music Sharing</h3>
<p>Encourage grandparents and older family members to share Christmas songs from their childhood while introducing them to contemporary devotional Christmas music. This builds family bonds while demonstrating how different generations can worship Jesus through music that reflects their cultural contexts.</p>
<p>Create family playlists that include traditional hymns, contemporary devotional songs like those from Seeds Kids Worship, and even appropriate songs from other cultures, helping children understand that Christmas is celebrated by believers worldwide through diverse musical expressions.</p>
<h2 id="song-selection-and-comparison-guidelines">Song Selection and Comparison Guidelines</h2>
<h3 id="evaluating-biblical-accuracy">Evaluating Biblical Accuracy</h3>
<p>Not all Christmas songs labeled as &ldquo;Christian&rdquo; maintain biblical accuracy. Teach children to evaluate Christmas music by asking questions like: &ldquo;Does this song teach us something true about Jesus from the Bible?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Would singing this song help us worship Jesus or just feel good about Christmas?&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://seedskidsworship.com/product/lying-in-a-manger-luke-215-16/">Lying In A Manger</a></strong> directly quotes Luke 2:15-16, making it easy for children to verify biblical accuracy by reading the referenced passage. Use such songs as examples of how Christian music should align with Scripture rather than just using Christian language.</p>
<h3 id="age-appropriate-content-selection">Age-Appropriate Content Selection</h3>
<p>Choose Christmas devotional songs that match children&rsquo;s developmental levels while gently stretching their understanding. Avoid songs with theological concepts that are too advanced, as these can create confusion or negative associations with worship music.</p>
<p>However, don&rsquo;t underestimate children&rsquo;s capacity for deep spiritual truth when it&rsquo;s presented in age-appropriate ways. <strong><a href="https://seedskidsworship.com/product/marys-song-of-praise-luke-146-50/">Mary&rsquo;s Song Of Praise</a></strong> presents sophisticated theology about God&rsquo;s character and Mary&rsquo;s response, but does so through beautiful melody and clear lyrics that children can understand and internalize.</p>
<h3 id="musical-quality-considerations">Musical Quality Considerations</h3>
<p>Children deserve high-quality music that engages their developing musical sensibilities while maintaining focus on biblical truth. Poor production quality or overly simplistic melodies can actually hinder spiritual development by creating negative associations with worship music.</p>
<p>Seeds Kids Worship Christmas songs combine professional musical arrangements with theologically rich lyrics, providing models of excellence that help children develop appreciation for quality Christian music while hiding God&rsquo;s Word in their hearts.</p>
<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3 id="how-do-i-balance-secular-and-religious-christmas-music-in-our-home">How do I balance secular and religious Christmas music in our home?</h3>
<p>Start by establishing that Christmas celebrates Jesus&rsquo; birthday, making worship songs the natural foundation of your Christmas music collection. Add high-quality secular Christmas music that celebrates family, generosity, and seasonal joy without undermining the spiritual focus of your holiday celebration.</p>
<p>Use secular Christmas songs as opportunities to discuss how cultural Christmas traditions can complement biblical Christmas celebration when kept in proper perspective. Help children understand that enjoying &ldquo;Jingle Bells&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t conflict with worshiping through <strong><a href="https://seedskidsworship.com/product/a-holy-miracle-matthew-123-2/">A Holy Miracle</a></strong>, but worship songs deserve priority because they celebrate the real reason for Christmas.</p>
<h3 id="what-if-my-children-resist-devotional-christmas-music-in-favor-of-fun-secular-songs">What if my children resist devotional Christmas music in favor of fun secular songs?</h3>
<p>Make devotional Christmas music more appealing by creating positive associations through family dance parties, special listening times with hot chocolate, or fun activities that accompany favorite worship songs. Children often resist unfamiliar music, so consistent, joyful exposure helps build appreciation.</p>
<p>Avoid creating conflicts between &ldquo;good&rdquo; and &ldquo;bad&rdquo; Christmas music. Instead, help children understand different types of songs serve different purposes. <strong><a href="https://seedskidsworship.com/product/the-newborn-king-2/">The Newborn King</a></strong> helps us worship Jesus, while &ldquo;Rudolph&rdquo; tells a fun story. Both can have places in Christmas celebration when kept in proper perspective.</p>
<h3 id="how-can-i-use-christmas-devotional-songs-with-children-who-have-different-learning-challenges">How can I use Christmas devotional songs with children who have different learning challenges?</h3>
<p>Adapt songs to meet various learning needs by modifying tempo, adding visual aids, or incorporating sensory experiences. Children with attention challenges might benefit from shorter song segments repeated frequently, while children with processing delays might need slower tempos and extra time to learn lyrics.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://seedskidsworship.com/product/silent-night-2/">Silent Night</a></strong> works well for children who are easily overstimulated because of its gentle, calming melody, while action-oriented children might prefer songs that allow for movement and physical expression during singing.</p>
<h3 id="when-should-we-start-introducing-christmas-devotional-songs-each-year">When should we start introducing Christmas devotional songs each year?</h3>
<p>Begin introducing Christmas devotional songs during the Advent season (typically beginning the Sunday after Thanksgiving) to build anticipation and prepare hearts for Christmas celebration. Starting too early can cause Christmas music fatigue, while waiting until Christmas week doesn&rsquo;t allow enough</p>
<p>Create calm-down playlists featuring gentle Christmas devotional songs like <strong><a href="https://seedskidsworship.com/product/silent-night-2/">Silent Night</a></strong> that children can listen to when feeling overwhelmed. Teaching children to use worship music for emotional regulation builds coping skills that will serve them throughout their lives.</p>
<h2 id="transform-your-familys-christmas-celebration-through-scripture-songs">Transform Your Family&rsquo;s Christmas Celebration Through Scripture Songs</h2>
<p>Christmas devotional songs offer your family the beautiful opportunity to celebrate Jesus&rsquo; birth while building lasting spiritual foundations in your children&rsquo;s hearts.
