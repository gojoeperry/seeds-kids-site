<p>Picture this: you&rsquo;re gently rocking your baby to sleep, softly humming &ldquo;Jesus Loves Me&rdquo; as those tiny eyes flutter closed. In that precious moment, you&rsquo;re doing something profound—planting seeds of faith through the timeless power of hymns.

<p>When we sing hymns to our babies, we&rsquo;re following a rich tradition that spans generations. These sacred songs carry eternal truths in simple, memorable forms that even the youngest hearts can absorb. Research shows that babies begin responding to music in the womb and continue developing musical recognition through their first years, making hymns a perfect vessel for early spiritual formation.</p>
