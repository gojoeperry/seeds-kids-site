# Christmas Kids Hymns: Teaching Children to Celebrate Jesus

### Introduction
Christmas kids hymns play a vital role in helping children understand and celebrate the true meaning of Christmas. These special songs combine memorable melodies with profound biblical truths, making them perfect tools for teaching young hearts about Jesus's birth. When children learn christmas kids hymns, they're not just memorizing words - they're storing up precious spiritual truths that can shape their faith for years to come. The simple yet powerful messages in these hymns help kids grasp concepts like God's love, the miracle of Jesus's birth, and the joy of salvation in age-appropriate ways. By incorporating christmas kids hymns into your family's or church's holiday celebrations, you're creating meaningful traditions while building a strong foundation of faith.

### Scripture
"Glory to God in the highest heaven, and on earth peace to those on whom his favor rests." - Luke 2:14

"For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given." - Isaiah 9:6

## Worship Ideas
1. "Away in a Manger" with hand motions: Have children rock their arms like holding a baby during "asleep," point up for "Lord," and make star shapes with their hands for "sky."

2. "Silent Night" candlelight activity: Use battery-operated candles and have kids raise them during the "heavenly light" verse.

3. "Joy to the World" praise parade: Let children march around the room with simple instruments like bells or tambourines while singing.

### Devotional Thought
Just as the shepherds and wise men came to worship baby Jesus, we too can worship Him with our songs and hearts. Jesus came as a tiny baby to show us how much God loves us. When we sing Christmas hymns, we're telling Jesus that we love Him too and thanking Him for coming to earth for us.

Dear Jesus, thank you for coming as a baby to save us. Help us worship you with joy as we sing these special songs. Amen.
