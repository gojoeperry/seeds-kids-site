- "Add gentle swaying movements during the chorus"

2. "Deep and Wide" with Full-Body Movements
- "Use expanding arm movements for "deep" and "wide"
- "Add squatting motions for "deep" and reaching for "wide"
- "Include marching in place during the repeated phrases"

3. "This Little Light of Mine"

- "Make circular motions for "all around the neighborhood"
- "Use hiding motions for "won't let Satan blow it out"

### Devotional Thought
Just as our bodies can move and dance to show joy, our hearts can leap with happiness when we praise God. Jesus loves to hear children sing and see them express their love through movement. When we use actions with our songs, we're praising God with our whole selves – just like King David did when he danced before the Lord.

Prayer: "Dear Jesus, thank you for giving us songs to sing and ways to move as we praise you. Help us to worship you with all our heart, mind, and strength. Amen."

### FAQs
Q: What age group is best suited for action songs?
A: Action songs are especially effective for children ages 2-10, but can be enjoyed by all ages. Younger children (2-5) particularly benefit from the combination of movement and music for learning and retention.

Q: How can I teach new action songs effectively?
A: Start by teaching the words first, then add movements gradually. Demonstrate the actions slowly, break them into small parts, and practice repeatedly. Make it fun and don't worry about perfection – enthusiasm is more important than precision.

Q: Where can I find resources for traditional Sunday school songs?
A: Many traditional Sunday school songs can be found in children's hymnals, Christian bookstores, and online platforms like YouTube Kids. Christian education websites often offer free printable lyrics and motion guides for classic songs.
