# Simple VBS Theme Songs for Kids' Worship

### Introduction
Simple VBS theme songs are powerful tools that help children connect with God through music and movement. These catchy, easy-to-learn songs create lasting memories while teaching biblical truths in an engaging way. When kids learn simple VBS theme songs, they're not just memorizing lyrics â€“ they're storing God's Word in their hearts through melody and rhythm. These songs often become favorites that children sing throughout the year, reinforcing the spiritual lessons long after VBS ends. Whether you're planning a Vacation Bible School program or looking for fun worship songs to use at home, simple VBS theme songs provide an excellent foundation for children's spiritual growth and development.

### Scripture
"Let everything that has breath praise the Lord. Praise the Lord!" (Psalm 150:6)

"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise." (Psalm 98:4)

## Worship Ideas
1. "Jesus' Love is Bubbling Over" - Have children pretend to be bubbles, starting small and crouched down, then slowly rising and spinning while singing about Jesus' love growing bigger and bigger.

2. "I Am a C-H-R-I-S-T-I-A-N" - Use body motions to spell out each letter while singing, making it a fun spelling and movement activity.

3. "This Little Light of Mine" - Give children battery-operated tea lights to hold while singing, raising them high during the chorus.

### Devotional Thought
Just as God created beautiful music, He created each of us to praise Him in our own special way. When we sing simple VBS theme songs, we're joining with angels and all of creation in worshipping our amazing God. He loves to hear our voices, whether we're great singers or just making a joyful noise!

Prayer: "Dear God, thank you for giving us music to praise You. Help us to sing with joy and share Your love with others through our songs. Amen."
