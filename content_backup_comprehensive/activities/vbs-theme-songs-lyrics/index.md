## VBS Theme Songs Lyrics: Making Worship Fun for Kids

### Introduction
VBS theme songs lyrics play a vital role in helping children connect with God through music and movement. These catchy, meaningful songs become anchors for biblical truth that kids carry with them long after Vacation Bible School ends. Whether you're a parent, Sunday school teacher, or VBS volunteer, having engaging VBS theme songs lyrics in your toolkit helps create memorable worship experiences that shape young hearts. The right combination of fun melodies and biblical messages makes these songs powerful tools for teaching kids about Jesus's love. From classic favorites to contemporary hits, VBS theme songs lyrics help build a foundation of faith through the universal language of music.

### Scripture
"Let everything that has breath praise the Lord! Praise the Lord!" - Psalm 150:6

"Sing to him, sing praise to him; tell of all his wonderful acts." - Psalm 105:2

## Worship Ideas
1. "Every Move I Make" - Have kids form a circle and follow simple motions: jumping on "move," pointing up for "Lord," and spinning for "dance." This energetic song teaches about God's presence.

2. "This Little Light of Mine" - Give each child a battery-operated tea light to hold up during the chorus. Add verses about shining at home, school, and church.

3. "Jesus Loves Me Rock" - Create hand motions for each verse and encourage kids to make up their own moves to express God's love.

### Devotional Thought
Just like a beautiful song has different parts that work together, God made each of us unique but part of His wonderful plan. When we sing VBS songs, we're joining with other children around the world to praise Jesus. He loves hearing our voices, whether we're good singers or not, because He cares about our hearts more than perfect notes.

Dear God, thank you for giving us music to praise You. Help us remember these songs and Your love throughout the year. Amen.
