# Easter Songs for Kids: Fun Bunny-Themed Worship

### Introduction
Looking for engaging easter songs for kids bunny themes that combine seasonal fun with spiritual meaning? These playful Easter worship songs help children understand the joy of Jesus' resurrection while incorporating familiar springtime symbols. Rather than avoiding the Easter bunny altogether, these easter songs for kids bunny selections thoughtfully bridge cultural traditions with biblical truth. By using friendly bunny imagery alongside resurrection themes, we can meet children where they are while pointing them to Christ. These songs create memorable teaching moments that stick with kids long after Easter Sunday, helping them grasp how all of creation - even little bunnies - celebrates our risen Savior.

### Scripture
"Let everything that has breath praise the Lord!" (Psalm 150:6)

"All the earth worships you and sings praises to you; they sing praises to your name." (Psalm 66:4)

## Worship Ideas
1. "Hippity Hop for Jesus" - Kids hop like bunnies while singing about Jesus' love. Include movements like wiggling noses and floppy ears while reciting "Jesus loves me."

2. "Easter Garden Praise" - Children pretend to be different spring creatures (bunnies, birds, flowers) taking turns praising Jesus. Each group can make their animal sound when it's their turn.

3. "Little Bunny's Easter Story" - A simple song telling how even forest creatures celebrated when Jesus rose. Include hand motions for peeking in the empty tomb.

### Devotional Thought
Just as bunnies wake up in spring bringing new life and joy, Jesus brings us new life through His resurrection. When we see Easter bunnies, we can remember that all of God's creation celebrates Jesus. Even the smallest creatures can praise Him!

Prayer: "Dear Jesus, thank you for giving us new life. Help us celebrate You with joy like all of creation does. Amen."
