# Christmas Songs For Kids With Actions

# Christmas Songs for Kids with Actions: Making Holiday Worship Fun and Meaningful

### Introduction
Teaching children Christmas songs with actions is a wonderful way to celebrate the birth of Jesus while engaging young hearts and minds in worship. When kids combine music with movement, they're more likely to remember both the melodies and the meaningful messages behind these special songs. Christmas songs for kids with actions help create lasting memories and plant seeds of faith that can grow throughout their lives. Whether you're a parent, Sunday school teacher, or children's ministry leader, incorporating action songs into your Christmas celebrations can transform ordinary moments into interactive worship experiences. Not only do these songs make learning about Jesus' birth more engaging, but they also help children express their joy and praise in a natural, age-appropriate way.

### Scripture
"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise." - Psalm 98:4

"Let them praise his name with dancing and make music to him with timbrel and harp." - Psalm 149:3

## Worship Ideas
1. "Joy to the World" with Star Jumps
- "Jump up with arms raised on "Joy"
- "Make a circle with arms for "World"
- "Point up for "Lord is come"

2. "Away in a Manger"
- "Rock baby Jesus motion"
- "Make star shapes with hands"
- "Fold hands in prayer for final verse"

3. "Little Drummer Boy"
- "March in place"
- "Drum motions on "pa rum pum pum pum"
- "Bow for "I played my best for Him"

### Devotional Thought
Just as the angels sang to announce Jesus' birth, we too can use our voices and actions to celebrate our Savior. When we sing and move in worship, we're showing God how happy we are that He sent Jesus to be our friend and Savior. Every action and every word can be a gift we give to Jesus, just like the shepherds and wise men brought their gifts to Him.

Dear Jesus, thank you for coming as a baby and giving us reasons to sing and celebrate. Help us worship you with our whole hearts, voices, and bodies. Amen.

### FAQs

### What age group is best for action Christmas songs?
Action songs work well for children ages 2-10, but can be adapted for any age. Toddlers enjoy simple motions, while older children can handle more complex movements and longer verses. Even teenagers and adults often enjoy participating when leading younger children!

### How can I teach new Christmas action songs effectively?
Start by teaching the actions separately from the words. Demonstrate the movements slowly, then add the words gradually. Practice one verse at a time, and use repetition. Make it fun and don't worry about perfection â€“ enthusiasm is more important than precision.

### Where can I find more Christmas songs with actions?
Many Christian children's ministry websites offer free resources for action songs. YouTube channels dedicated to children's worship often demonstrate movements. Your local Christian bookstore likely carries DVDs and resources specifically for Christmas action songs. Church curriculum publishers also typically include seasonal music with suggested movements.
