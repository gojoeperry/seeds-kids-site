### Scripture
"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise." - Psalm 98:4

"Let everything that has breath praise the Lord. Praise the Lord!" - Psalm 150:6

## Worship Ideas
1. "Jesus Loves Me" Circle Time: Form a circle and strum simple chords while children walk around, adding motions for "yes," "love," and "Bible."

2. "This Little Light of Mine" Action Song: Use finger motions for the "light," and have kids take turns showing where they'll let their light shine.

3. "He's Got the Whole World" Interactive Praise: Let children suggest things to add to the song (animals, family members, friends) while showing the corresponding hand motions.

### Devotional Thought
Just as different musical notes come together to make a beautiful song, God created each of us uniquely to praise Him in our own special way. When we sing together, we're like a wonderful choir in God's ears. He loves hearing our voices, whether we're perfectly in tune or just making a joyful noise!

Dear God, thank you for giving us music to praise you. Help us remember that you love hearing our songs, no matter how they sound. Amen.
