"The Lord is my strength and my song; he has become my salvation." - Exodus 15:2

## Worship Ideas

2. "God's Love Is Like a Happy Jump" - Kids jump, spin, and raise hands to show different ways God's love makes us feel
3. "Easter Morning Happy Day" - Create simple egg shakers for rhythm and have children march in a circle while singing about the empty tomb

### Devotional Thought
Just as spring brings new flowers and baby animals, Easter reminds us that Jesus makes everything new. When Jesus rose from the dead, He showed us God's amazing love and power. Every time we sing Easter songs, we're telling this wonderful story and thanking God for His gift of Jesus.

Dear God, thank you for giving us Jesus and for Easter songs that help us remember Your love. Help us sing with joy and share Your love with others. Amen.
