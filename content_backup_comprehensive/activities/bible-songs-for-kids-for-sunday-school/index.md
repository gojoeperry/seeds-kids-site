### Devotional Thought
Just as music fills a room with beautiful sounds, God's love fills our hearts with joy. When we sing praise songs, we're telling God how much we love Him, just like birds sing their beautiful songs each morning. Remember that God loves hearing your voice, whether you're a great singer or just making a joyful noise!

Prayer: "Dear God, thank you for giving us music to praise you. Help us use our voices to share your love with others. Amen."
