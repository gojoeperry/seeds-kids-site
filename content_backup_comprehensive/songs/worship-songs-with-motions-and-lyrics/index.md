# Worship Songs With Motions And Lyrics

## Teaching Kids Worship Songs with Motions and Lyrics

### Introduction
Introducing children to worship songs with motions and lyrics creates a foundation for lifelong faith and joyful expression. When kids combine music, movement, and meaningful words, they engage their whole selves in praising God. These worship songs with motions and lyrics help children memorize biblical truths while having fun and building community with other young believers. Research shows that physical movement paired with music enhances learning and memory retention, making motion-based worship songs particularly effective for teaching spiritual concepts to children. As parents and teachers, we have the wonderful opportunity to guide our little ones in expressing their love for God through these engaging worship experiences.

### Scripture
"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise." - Psalm 98:4

"Let everything that has breath praise the Lord. Praise the Lord!" - Psalm 150:6

## Worship Ideas
1. "Every Move I Make" - Have children jump on "move," wave arms for "waves of mercy," and spin for "in Your presence." This classic worship song with motions helps kids understand God's constant presence.

2. "Jesus Loves Me" with Sign Language - Teach basic sign language motions for key words like "love," "Jesus," and "Bible." This adds a meaningful dimension to this beloved song while making it accessible for all abilities.

3. "This Little Light of Mine" - Use finger motions for the "light," hiding actions for "under a bushel," and pointing movements for directional words. Perfect for both home and Sunday School settings.

### Devotional Thought
Just as our bodies can move and dance, our hearts can also move with love for Jesus. When we worship with songs and motions, we're showing God that we love Him with everything we are - our voices, our movements, and our hearts. Jesus loves to see His children worship with such joy and freedom!

Prayer: "Dear Jesus, thank you for giving us songs to sing and ways to move as we worship You. Help us remember that You love to see us praise You with our whole hearts. Amen."
