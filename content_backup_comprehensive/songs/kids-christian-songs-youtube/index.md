### Devotional Thought
Just as birds sing their beautiful songs to express joy, God gave us voices to sing His praises. When we worship through music, we're showing God how much we love Him, just like giving a special gift to someone we care about. Jesus loves to hear children's voices lifted in praise!

Dear God, thank you for music and for giving us ways to worship You. Help us use our voices to share Your love with others. Amen.
