# Kids Hymns for Preschoolers: Building Faith Through Song

### Introduction
Teaching kids hymns for preschoolers is a wonderful way to plant seeds of faith in young hearts. These timeless songs help little ones connect with God through simple melodies and meaningful lyrics that they can understand and remember. When preschoolers learn hymns early, they develop a foundation for worship that can last a lifetime. The repetitive nature of kids hymns for preschoolers makes them especially effective for teaching biblical truths, as young children naturally love to sing and repeat familiar tunes. Whether at home, in Sunday school, or during family devotions, incorporating these special hymns helps create precious moments of worship that nurture spiritual growth and create lasting memories. Parents and teachers can use these songs to introduce fundamental concepts about God's love, Jesus's care, and the beauty of Christian faith in an age-appropriate way.

### Scripture
"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise." - Psalm 98:4

"Let everything that has breath praise the Lord. Praise the Lord!" - Psalm 150:6

## Worship Ideas
1. "Jesus Loves Me" with simple hand motions:
   - "Point to self on "me"
   - "Cross arms over heart for "loves"
   - "Point up for "Jesus"

2. "This Little Light of Mine" with actions:
   - "Hold up pointer finger as "light"
   - "Hide hands behind back for "hide it under a bushel"
   - "Make wind-blowing motion for "won't let Satan blow it out"

3. Create a rhythm band using toy instruments while singing "He's Got the Whole World in His Hands"

### Devotional Thought
God loves to hear children sing! Just like parents smile when their little ones sing, our Heavenly Father delights in hearing preschoolers praise Him. Jesus said to let the little children come to Him, and singing hymns is one beautiful way they can do that. Even when the words aren't perfect or the tune is a little off, God treasures every song from a child's heart.

Prayer: "Dear Jesus, thank you for giving us songs to sing about your love. Help us make joyful music for you. Amen."

### FAQs

### What age should children start learning hymns?
Children can start learning hymns as early as age 2-3. Start with simple, repetitive songs with basic concepts about God's love. As they grow, gradually introduce more complex hymns with deeper meanings.

### How can I teach hymns to active preschoolers who won't sit still?
Incorporate movement and actions into the songs. Use hand motions, simple dance steps, or musical instruments. Keep sessions short (5-10 minutes) and make it fun. Don't worry about perfection â€“ focus on joyful participation.

### Where can I find good hymns for preschoolers?
Look for children's hymnals at Christian bookstores, ask your church's children's ministry for resources, or explore Christian music streaming services with kids' worship playlists. Many websites also offer free printable lyrics and sheet music for classic children's hymns.
