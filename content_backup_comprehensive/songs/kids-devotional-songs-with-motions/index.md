# Kids Devotional Songs With Motions

## Kids Devotional Songs with Motions: Making Worship Fun and Meaningful

### Introduction
Kids devotional songs with motions offer a powerful way to help children connect with God through music, movement, and meaningful lyrics. When children engage their whole bodies in worship, they're more likely to remember biblical truths and experience God's presence in a tangible way. These interactive worship experiences create lasting memories and help build a strong spiritual foundation. By incorporating kids devotional songs with motions into your family or ministry routine, you're giving children tools to express their faith naturally and joyfully. Movement-based worship songs also help active children focus their energy while learning about God's love, making spiritual teaching both fun and memorable.

### Scripture
"Let them praise his name with dancing and make music to him with timbrel and harp." - Psalm 149:3

"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise." - Psalm 98:4

## Worship Ideas
1. "Every Move I Make" - Children jump on "move," reach high on "wave," and spin on "breath." This song teaches about God's presence in everything we do.

2. "Deep and Wide" - Traditional motions showing depth and width, adding new verses and corresponding movements. Perfect for teaching about God's infinite love.

3. "This Little Light of Mine" - Hold up pointer fingers as "lights," make circular motions, and hide hands behind backs for "bushel." Teaches about sharing God's love.

### Devotional Thought
Just as our bodies can move and dance, God's love moves in our hearts. When we worship with our whole selves - singing, dancing, and moving - we're showing God how much we love Him. Jesus wants us to come to Him like little children, full of joy and ready to express our love freely.

Prayer: "Dear Jesus, thank you for giving us songs to sing and ways to move as we worship You. Help us remember that You love to see us dance and sing for You. Amen."
