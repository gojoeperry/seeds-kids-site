# What Kind Of Music Is Good For Children?

# What Kind of Music is Good for Children?
### Introduction
When considering what kind of music is good for children, it's essential to choose songs that nurture both their faith and emotional development. The right music can plant seeds of truth in young hearts while creating joyful memories of worship. As parents and teachers, we want to be intentional about what kind of music is good for children because these early experiences shape their understanding of God and their place in His family. Music has a unique way of bypassing the mind and speaking directly to the heart, making it a powerful tool for teaching biblical truths. When children engage with age-appropriate worship music, they're not just learning lyrics – they're developing a foundation for lifelong faith and finding their own voice in praising God.

### Scripture
"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise." - Psalm 98:4

"Let everything that has breath praise the Lord. Praise the Lord!" - Psalm 150:6

## Worship Ideas
- "The B-I-B-L-E" with hand motions (pointing to an imaginary Bible, then making a cross shape)
- "Jesus Loves Me" with simple sign language for key words like "love," "strong," and "belong"
- "Create a praise parade where children march around the room with musical instruments, waving ribbons while singing familiar worship songs"
- "Use rhythm sticks or tambourines to help children keep beat while learning new songs about God's love"

### Devotional Thought
Just as birds sing their special songs each morning, God gave us voices to sing His praises too! When we worship, we're telling God how much we love Him and thanking Him for all He's done. Jesus loves to hear children's voices lifted in song – remember how He welcomed the little children to come to Him? Every time we sing about God's love, it makes His heart happy.

Dear God, thank you for music and for giving us voices to praise You. Help us to sing with joy and to remember Your love. Amen.

### FAQs

Children can start learning worship songs from infancy! Even babies respond to gentle melodies, and toddlers naturally love music. Start with simple songs and add more complex ones as they grow.

### How can I make worship music more engaging for my children?
Add movement and actions to songs, use musical instruments (even homemade ones), and let children help choose songs. Make it interactive by asking them to create their own worship movements or suggest new verses.

### Where can I find good Christian music for kids?
Look for children's worship music from trusted Christian artists like Yancy, Seeds Family Worship, or Hillsong Kids. Many churches also offer children's worship albums, and there are numerous Christian streaming platforms with dedicated kids' channels.
