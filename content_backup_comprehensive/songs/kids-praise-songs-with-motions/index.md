# Kids Praise Songs With Motions

# Kids Praise Songs with Motions: Making Worship Fun and Meaningful

### Introduction
Kids praise songs with motions provide an engaging and memorable way for children to connect with God through worship. When young ones combine music with movement, they're not just singing – they're using their whole bodies to express love for Jesus. These interactive worship experiences help children internalize biblical truths while creating joyful memories that can last a lifetime. By incorporating kids praise songs with motions into your family or ministry time, you're helping children develop a natural, expressive approach to worship that meets them right where they are developmentally. The combination of rhythm, movement, and Scripture-based lyrics makes spiritual truths stick while keeping kids actively engaged in the worship experience.

### Scripture
"Let them praise his name with dancing and make music to him with timbrel and harp." - Psalm 149:3

"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise." - Psalm 98:4

## Worship Ideas
1. "Every Move I Make": Have children jump during "na na na," stretch arms up for "waves of mercy," and make wave motions for "waves of grace."

2. "Deep and Wide": Use traditional hand motions while singing, then make it fun by singing without vowels or consonants while keeping the motions going.

3. "This Little Light of Mine": Hold up pointer fingers as "lights," hide them behind backs for "hide it under a bushel," and make wind-blowing motions for "won't let Satan blow it out."

### Devotional Thought
Just as we use our whole bodies to show excitement about things we love – like jumping up and down when we're happy – God loves to see us express our joy in Him through movement and song. Jesus welcomes our praise whether it's quiet or loud, still or moving. When we worship with our whole selves, we're showing God how much we love Him.

Prayer: "Dear Jesus, thank you for giving us music and movement to praise you. Help us worship you with joy in our hearts. Amen."

### FAQs

**What age group is best for action songs?**
Action songs work well for children ages 2-12, but they're especially effective for preschool and elementary-aged kids (3-10 years old). Younger children love simple motions, while older kids can handle more complex movements and enjoy leading others.

**How can I teach new motions to a group of kids?**
Start by demonstrating the motions slowly without music. Break down complex movements into simple steps. Then add the music at a slower pace, gradually increasing to normal speed. Remember to keep it fun and praise effort over perfection.

**Where can I find good kids worship songs with motions?**
Many Christian children's ministries like Hillsong Kids, Yancy Ministries, and Go Fish offer videos and resources for action-based worship songs. YouTube channels dedicated to children's ministry often demonstrate motions, and curriculum providers like Orange and Group Publishing include motion-based worship in their programs.
