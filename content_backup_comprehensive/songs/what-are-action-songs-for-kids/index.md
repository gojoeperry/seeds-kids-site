"Let them praise his name with dancing and make music to him with timbrel and harp." - Psalm 149:3

"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise." - Psalm 98:4

## Worship Ideas
1. "Jesus' Love is Bubbling Over" - Children pretend to be bubbles, jumping up and down while singing about Jesus' love overflowing in their hearts.

2. "This Little Light of Mine" - Kids hold up pointer fingers like candles, moving them in different directions while singing about sharing God's light.

3. "Father Abraham" - A classic action song where children perform different movements (right arm, left arm, right foot, etc.) while singing about being children of faith.

### Devotional Thought
Just as our bodies move and dance when we're happy, God loves to see us express our joy in worship. When we sing and move in praise to Him, we're using the amazing bodies He gave us to show Him how much we love Him. Jesus welcomed children to come to Him, and He delights in their energetic worship.

Prayer: "Dear Jesus, thank you for giving us songs to sing and ways to move as we worship You. Help us to always praise You with joy in our hearts. Amen."
