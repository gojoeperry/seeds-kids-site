# Worship Songs for Kids with Actions: Making Praise Fun and Meaningful

### Introduction
Teaching worship songs for kids with actions is one of the most effective ways to help children connect with God through music and movement. When young hearts and hands come together in praise, they experience God's presence in an unforgettable way. By incorporating actions and motions into worship songs, kids not only memorize biblical truths more easily but also engage their whole bodies in expressing love for Jesus. Parents and teachers will find that worship songs for kids with actions create lasting memories while building a strong foundation of faith. This active approach to worship helps children understand that praising God can be both meaningful and fun, setting them up for a lifetime of joyful devotion.

### Scripture
"Let them praise his name with dancing and make music to him with timbrel and harp." - Psalm 149:3

"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise." - Psalm 98:4

## Worship Ideas
1. "Every Move I Make" - Have kids jump on "move," wave arms on "wave," and bow on "Lord." This simple song teaches about God's presence everywhere.

2. "This Little Light of Mine" - Hold up pointer fingers as "lights," hide them behind backs for "hide it under a bushel," and make wind-blowing motions for "won't let Satan blow it out."

3. "Father Abraham" - This classic action song gets kids moving with right arm, left arm, right foot, left foot, chin up, turn around, and sit down!

### Devotional Thought
Just as we use our whole bodies to show excitement about things we love, God wants us to express our love for Him with our entire being. When we jump, dance, and move in worship, we're telling God how much we adore Him. Jesus loves to see children worship with pure hearts and enthusiastic actions.

Prayer: "Dear Jesus, thank you for giving us bodies that can move and dance for you. Help us worship you with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength. Amen."
