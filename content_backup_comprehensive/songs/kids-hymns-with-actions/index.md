# Kids Hymns With Actions

# Teaching Kids Hymns with Actions: Making Worship Fun and Meaningful

### Introduction
Teaching kids hymns with actions is a wonderful way to help children engage with worship and hide God's truth in their hearts. When we combine memorable melodies with physical movements, children naturally connect with the message while having fun. Kids hymns with actions create lasting spiritual memories and help young ones express their love for God through both song and movement. Not only do action songs make worship more engaging, but they also help children remember biblical truths long after the music ends. As parents and teachers, incorporating kids hymns with actions into our worship time helps channel children's natural energy while teaching them important foundations of faith in an age-appropriate way.

### Scripture
"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise." - Psalm 98:4

"Let everything that has breath praise the Lord. Praise the Lord!" - Psalm 150:6

## Worship Ideas
1. "Jesus Loves Me" with Sign Language
- "Teach basic sign language for key words like "love," "Jesus," and "Bible"
- "Add simple gestures for "strong," "weak," and "belong"

2. "This Little Light of Mine"
- "Hold up finger-lights or flashlights for "light"
- "Cup hands to "hide it under a bushel"
- "Make wind-blowing motions for "won't let Satan blow it out"

3. "He's Got the Whole World in His Hands"
- "Use arm movements to form a circle for "whole world"
- "Rock baby motions for "little bitty babies"
- "Flying motions for "birds and bees"

### Devotional Thought
Just as our bodies can move and dance, our hearts can also move with love for Jesus. When we sing and do motions together, we're showing God that we love Him with everything we have - our voices, our bodies, and our hearts. Jesus loves to see children worship Him with joy and enthusiasm!

Prayer: "Dear Jesus, thank you for giving us songs to sing and ways to move as we worship You. Help us remember that you love to hear our praise. Amen."

### FAQs

Children as young as 18 months can begin learning simple worship songs with actions. Start with basic movements and short, repetitive songs, gradually introducing more complex actions as children grow older.

**How can I teach kids hymns with actions if I'm not musical?**
You don't need to be a skilled musician! Use worship videos, recordings, or simple hand motions. Focus on enthusiasm and participation rather than perfect performance. Children respond more to your joy and engagement than musical ability.

**Where can I find resources for kids hymns with actions?**
Look for children's worship videos on YouTube, Christian streaming platforms, or church curriculum providers. Many children's ministry websites offer free printable action guides for popular hymns and worship songs. Your local Christian bookstore may also have DVDs and songbooks specifically designed for children's worship.
