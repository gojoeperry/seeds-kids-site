### Scripture
"When you lie down, you will not be afraid; when you lie down, your sleep will be sweet." - Proverbs 3:24

"The Lord your God is with you, he is mighty to save. He will take great delight in you, he will quiet you with his love." - Zephaniah 3:17

## Worship Ideas
1. "Jesus Loves Me Lullaby" - Sing the traditional song at a slower pace, adding gentle swaying motions
2. "Guardian Angel Prayer Song" - Create a simple melody using the prayer "Angel of God, my guardian dear"
3. "Bedtime Blessing Circle" - Hold hands as a family and sing "God is so good" while gently swaying before bed

Include soft hand motions and encourage children to hum along as they get sleepy. These activities work perfectly for both home bedtime routines and church nursery settings.

### Devotional Thought
Just as we feel safe and loved in our warm beds at night, God's love surrounds us all the time. He watches over us while we sleep, just like a loving parent. Jesus wants to be close to us during both our busy daytime activities and our quiet nighttime rest.

Dear God, thank you for watching over us as we sleep. Help us remember that you are always with us, keeping us safe and sharing your love. Amen.

### FAQs

You can begin using Christian lullabies from birth. Babies respond to gentle music from their earliest days, and establishing this spiritual routine early helps create positive sleep associations.

Create a consistent routine that includes dimmed lights, quiet voices, and perhaps a special blanket or stuffed animal. Talk about the lyrics' meanings in simple terms, and share how God's love relates to the songs you're singing.

### Where can I find quality Christian lullabies with lyrics?
Look for Christian lullaby collections on platforms like Spotify or YouTube. Many Christian children's artists offer dedicated lullaby albums. Your local Christian bookstore likely carries CDs specifically designed for bedtime worship. You can also find printable lyrics sheets on Christian parenting websites and ministry resources.
