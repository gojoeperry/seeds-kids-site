# Cedarmont Kids Hymns: Teaching Timeless Truth to Young Hearts

### Introduction
Cedarmont Kids hymns have been a treasured resource for introducing children to the rich heritage of Christian music for decades. These beloved arrangements take traditional hymns and present them in kid-friendly ways, making eternal truths accessible to young minds and hearts. By incorporating Cedarmont Kids hymns into your family's or ministry's worship time, you're helping children build a strong spiritual foundation through music they can understand and enjoy. The simple melodies and clear lyrics help kids grasp important concepts about God's love, faithfulness, and grace. Whether you're a parent, Sunday School teacher, or children's ministry leader, Cedarmont Kids hymns provide a wonderful way to connect children with timeless truths that have encouraged believers for generations.

### Scripture
"Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom, singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, with thankfulness in your hearts to God." - Colossians 3:16

"Make a joyful noise to the Lord, all the earth! Serve the Lord with gladness! Come into his presence with singing!" - Psalm 100:1-2

## Worship Ideas
1. Create a "Hymn Heroes" time where kids learn one new hymn each month using Cedarmont Kids versions. Add simple hand motions to help remember key phrases.

2. Make a praise parade with rhythm instruments while singing familiar hymns. Let children march around the room playing tambourines, shakers, or bells.

3. Use picture cards to illustrate hymn concepts. For example, when singing "Jesus Loves Me," show images of ways Jesus shows His love.

### Devotional Thought
Just as we learn to talk by listening to our parents, we learn to praise God by singing His truths. Hymns are like special letters from God's people telling us about His amazing love and power. When we sing these songs, we're joining with Christians from all over the world and throughout history in praising our wonderful God.

Dear God, thank you for giving us music to praise You. Help us learn more about You through the songs we sing. Amen.
