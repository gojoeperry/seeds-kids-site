# Christian Songs With Actions

# Christian Songs with Actions for Kids' Worship

### Introduction
Teaching children Christian songs with actions is one of the most effective and joyful ways to help them engage with their faith. When kids combine music, movement, and biblical truth, they create lasting memories and develop a deeper understanding of God's love. Christian songs with actions help children express their worship physically while memorizing important spiritual concepts. This multi-sensory approach to worship isn't just fun – it's backed by educational research showing that movement helps cement learning in young minds. Whether you're a parent, Sunday school teacher, or children's ministry leader, incorporating action songs into your worship time creates an engaging environment where kids can praise God with their whole hearts and bodies.

### Scripture
"Let them praise his name with dancing and make music to him with timbrel and harp." - Psalm 149:3

"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise." - Psalm 98:4

## Worship Ideas
1. "Jesus' Love is Bubbling Over" - Children make bubbling motions with their hands while rising from crouching to standing, showing how Jesus' love grows and overflows.

2. "This Little Light of Mine" - Kids hold up one finger as their "light," moving it in different directions and hiding it under their other hand during appropriate lyrics.

3. "Father Abraham" - A classic action song where children move their arms, legs, head, and entire body while singing about being children of faith.

### Devotional Thought
Just as our bodies can move and dance, God's love moves in our hearts. When we sing and move together in worship, we're showing God that we love Him with everything we have – our voices, our bodies, and our hearts. Jesus wants us to come to Him like little children, full of joy and ready to express our love freely.

Prayer: "Dear Jesus, thank you for giving us songs to sing and ways to move as we worship you. Help us to always praise you with joy in our hearts. Amen."

### FAQs

### What age group is best for action songs?
Action songs work well for children ages 2-12, but they're especially effective for preschool and elementary-age kids (ages 3-8). Younger children love the movement and repetition, while older kids can help lead and understand deeper meanings in the lyrics.

### How can I teach action songs effectively to a group?
Start by demonstrating the actions slowly while explaining them. Break down complex movements into simple steps. Practice the actions first without music, then add the song. Remember to be enthusiastic – your energy will help kids feel comfortable participating.

### Where can I find good Christian action songs for kids?
You can find Christian action songs through children's ministry websites, YouTube channels like Seeds Family Worship or KidSpring, and Christian children's music publishers. Many churches also offer resources through their children's ministry departments, and there are numerous Christian children's worship albums available on streaming platforms.
