# Praise Action Songs For Kids

# Praise Action Songs for Kids: Engaging Young Hearts in Worship

### Introduction
Praise action songs for kids provide an energetic and meaningful way for children to express their love for God while learning important spiritual truths. By combining music with movement, praise action songs for kids create an engaging worship experience that helps young ones connect with their faith on multiple levels. Children naturally love to move, dance, and sing, making action songs the perfect vehicle for worship that speaks their language. When kids participate in these dynamic worship experiences, they're not just having fun – they're building lasting memories of God's love and developing habits of praise that can shape their spiritual journey for years to come. As parents and teachers, introducing children to active worship helps them understand that praising God can be both reverent and joyful.

### Scripture
"Let them praise his name with dancing and make music to him with timbrel and harp." - Psalm 149:3

"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise." - Psalm 98:4

## Worship Ideas
1. "Jesus' Love Is Like a Rainbow" - Children raise their arms to make rainbow shapes while singing about God's colorful creation and endless love
2. "I'm in the Lord's Army" - Kids march in place, salute, and follow simple military-style movements while declaring they're on God's team
3. "This Little Light of Mine" - Hold up fingers as candles, wave hands high and low, and turn in circles while singing about sharing God's light

### Devotional Thought
Just as our bodies can jump, dance, and move in praise, our hearts can leap with joy for Jesus. When we worship with our whole selves – our voices, our movements, and our hearts – we show God how much we love Him. He gave us our bodies and our energy, and we can give it all back to Him in praise!

Prayer: "Dear Jesus, thank you for giving us songs to sing and ways to move as we worship You. Help us remember that praise can be fun and full of joy! Amen."
