# Kids Hymns List

# Kids Hymns List: Building Faith Through Music

### Introduction
Creating a meaningful kids hymns list is an essential part of helping children grow in their faith journey. Traditional hymns adapted for young voices provide a strong foundation of biblical truth while engaging children's natural love of music and movement. When kids learn classic hymns alongside contemporary worship songs, they connect with centuries of Christian heritage in an age-appropriate way. The right kids hymns list can make worship time both fun and formative, helping little ones understand and remember important truths about God's love. Whether you're a parent, Sunday school teacher, or children's ministry leader, introducing hymns to children helps plant seeds of faith that can grow throughout their lives.

### Scripture
"Let everything that has breath praise the Lord!" (Psalm 150:6)
"Sing to the Lord a new song; sing to the Lord, all the earth." (Psalm 96:1)

## Worship Ideas
1. "Jesus Loves Me" with Sign Language
Create simple hand motions for key phrases like "loves me," "weak," and "strong." Children can learn both the hymn and basic sign language simultaneously.

2. "This Little Light of Mine" Movement Circle
Form a circle and let children take turns being in the middle, holding a battery-operated candle while others march and sing.

3. "He's Got the Whole World in His Hands"
Use a beach ball decorated like Earth, passing it around as different verses are sung.

### Devotional Thought
Just as birds sing their special songs each morning, God gave us voices to praise Him. When we sing hymns, we're joining with Christians from all over the world and throughout history in telling God how much we love Him. Even Jesus sang hymns with His disciples! Remember, it doesn't matter if your voice is loud or soft â€“ God loves hearing all His children sing to Him.

Dear God, thank you for the gift of music and for hymns that help us learn about your love. Help us to sing with joy in our hearts. Amen.

### FAQs

### What age should children start learning hymns?
Children can start learning simple hymns as early as age 2-3. Start with short, repetitive choruses and gradually introduce more complex hymns as they grow. By age 5-6, many children can learn traditional hymns with multiple verses.

### How can I make hymn singing more engaging for kids?
Include hand motions, percussion instruments, or visual aids while singing. Create story times around hymn themes, use coloring sheets with hymn lyrics, and let children take turns leading. Making it interactive helps maintain interest and aids memory.

### Where can I find kid-friendly versions of traditional hymns?
Many children's ministry websites offer free printable lyrics and sheet music. Christian bookstores carry hymn collections specifically arranged for children. Popular options include "Cedarmont Kids Hymns" and "Classic Hymns for Kids" series. YouTube also features numerous child-friendly hymn performances with animations.
