# Worship Songs For Toddlers With Lyrics

# Teaching Toddlers to Worship Through Song

### Introduction
Introducing worship songs for toddlers with lyrics is one of the most beautiful ways to plant seeds of faith in young hearts. When little ones learn to praise God through simple, engaging songs, they begin developing a lifelong foundation of worship. The right worship songs for toddlers with lyrics can make spiritual truths accessible and memorable, helping them understand God's love in age-appropriate ways. As parents and teachers, we have the precious opportunity to guide these little worshippers in expressing their love for Jesus through music. Whether at home, in Sunday school, or during family devotion time, incorporating toddler-friendly worship creates joyful moments of connection with God and helps establish positive associations with faith from the earliest years.

### Scripture
"Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these." - Matthew 19:14

"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth!" - Psalm 100:1

2. "This Little Light of Mine"
- "Hold up pointer finger as a "light"
- "Hide hand behind back for "hide it under a bushel"
- "Make wind-blowing motion for "won't let Satan blow it out"

3. "If You're Happy and You Know It, Praise the Lord"

### Devotional Thought
God delights in the praise of His little ones! Just as parents smile when their children sing, our Heavenly Father loves hearing toddlers worship Him. Jesus showed special care for children, welcoming them and blessing them. When we teach our little ones to worship, we're helping them discover the joy of knowing God's love.

Prayer: "Dear Jesus, thank you for loving our little ones. Help them grow to know and love you more each day. Make their hearts full of joy as they sing your praises. Amen."

### FAQs

### What age should I start teaching worship songs to my child?
You can begin introducing worship songs as early as infancy! Babies respond to melodies and rhythm, and toddlers naturally love music. Start with simple songs and gradually add more complex ones as they grow.

### How can I make worship time more engaging for my toddler?
Keep sessions short (5-10 minutes), use lots of movement and actions, and incorporate simple instruments like tambourines or shakers. Make it fun and don't worry about perfection â€“ enthusiasm matters more than accuracy!

### Where can I find good worship songs for toddlers?
Look for children's worship resources from Christian publishers like Hillsong Kids, Seeds Family Worship, or Yancy Ministries. YouTube channels dedicated to Christian children's music are also excellent sources. Your local church's children's ministry might have recommended playlists or resources to share.
