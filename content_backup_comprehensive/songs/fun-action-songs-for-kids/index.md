# Fun Action Songs For Kids

# Fun Action Songs for Kids: Engaging Children in Joyful Worship

### Introduction
Fun action songs for kids are more than just entertaining musical activities - they're powerful tools for helping children connect with God through worship. When young ones combine physical movement with praise, they engage their whole selves in expressing love for Jesus. Fun action songs for kids create lasting memories of joy-filled worship experiences while teaching biblical truths in an age-appropriate way. These songs help children understand that worship can be exciting and interactive, setting a foundation for lifelong faith. By incorporating movement and actions into worship time, we help kids release energy while focusing their hearts and minds on God. Whether at home, church, or Sunday school, action songs make worship accessible and enjoyable for children of all ages.

### Scripture
"Let them praise his name with dancing and make music to him with timbrel and harp." - Psalm 149:3

"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise." - Psalm 98:4

## Worship Ideas
1. "Jesus' Love is Bubbling Over" - Kids pretend to be bubbling fountains, starting low and slowly rising with arms waving, then "overflow" with God's love.

2. "This Little Light of Mine" - Children hold up pointer fingers as "lights," hiding them under their other hand, then behind their back, finally letting their light shine bright.

3. "Father Abraham" - A classic action song where kids follow progressive movements (right arm, left arm, right foot, etc.) while marching in place.

### Devotional Thought
Just as our bodies can move and dance, God wants our hearts to move with love for Him. When we sing and dance in worship, we're showing God how happy we are to be His children. Jesus loves to see us express our joy! Remember, worship isn't about performing perfectly - it's about giving our whole selves to God with happiness and freedom.

Dear God, thank you for giving us songs to sing and ways to move as we worship You. Help us remember that You love to see us praise You with joy. Amen.

### FAQs

Q: How can I teach new action songs to kids effectively?

Q: Where can I find good action songs for kids' worship?
A: Many Christian children's ministry websites offer free action song resources. Popular sources include Hillsong Kids, Orange Kids Music, and Seeds Family Worship. Your local Christian bookstore likely has DVDs and CDs specifically designed for children's worship.
