# Fun Christian Songs with Motions for Kids Worship

### Introduction
Teaching children to worship through fun Christian songs with motions is one of the most effective ways to help them connect with God. When kids combine music, movement, and biblical truth, they create lasting memories and develop a foundation for lifelong faith. Fun Christian songs with motions engage multiple senses, making the learning experience more memorable and meaningful. Not only do these songs help children remember important Scripture verses and biblical principles, but they also allow kids to express their joy in the Lord through physical movement. As parents and teachers, incorporating active worship helps channel children's natural energy while teaching them that praising God can be both reverent and enjoyable.

### Scripture
"Let them praise his name with dancing and make music to him with timbrel and harp." - Psalm 149:3

"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise." - Psalm 98:4

## Worship Ideas
1. "Every Move I Make" - Children follow simple hand motions pointing up for "Na na na" and wave arms for "waves of mercy"
2. "Jesus Loves Me" with Sign Language - Teach basic sign language motions for key words like "love," "Jesus," and "Bible"
3. "This Little Light of Mine" - Kids hold up pointer fingers as "lights" and perform various motions like hiding under a bush (covering light with other hand) or letting it shine (moving finger in circles)

### Devotional Thought
Just as our bodies can move and dance, our hearts can also move with love for Jesus. When we sing and do motions, we're using our whole selves to show God how much we love Him. Jesus wants us to come to Him like little children, with joy and enthusiasm. Remember, worship isn't just about being quiet and still - it's about expressing our love for God in many different ways!

Prayer: "Dear Jesus, thank you for giving us music and movement to praise you. Help us worship you with all our heart, mind, and strength. Amen."

### FAQs

### What age group is best for worship songs with motions?
Motion songs work well for children ages 2-12, but they're especially effective for preschool and elementary-aged kids (3-8 years old). Younger children naturally respond to music with movement, while older kids can handle more complex motions and lyrics.

### How can I teach new motions to a group of children?
Start by breaking down the motions into simple steps, demonstrating them slowly without music first. Then add the words, and finally incorporate the music. Practice one section at a time, and don't forget to make it fun and praise their efforts!

### Where can I find good Christian motion songs for kids?
You can find excellent resources through Christian children's ministry websites, YouTube channels like Seeds Family Worship or Go Fish Kids, and curriculum providers such as Orange or Group Publishing. Many churches also offer children's worship DVDs or digital downloads with motion tutorials.
