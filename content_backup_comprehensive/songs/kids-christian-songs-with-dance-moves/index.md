# Kids Christian Songs With Dance Moves

# Teaching Kids Christian Songs with Dance Moves

### Introduction
Getting children excited about worship through kids Christian songs with dance moves is one of the most joyful and effective ways to nurture their faith. When young ones combine music, movement, and praise, they engage their whole selves in worshipping God. Not only does this make spiritual teaching more memorable, but it also helps children express their love for Jesus in a natural, age-appropriate way. Whether you're a parent, Sunday school teacher, or children's ministry leader, incorporating kids Christian songs with dance moves into your spiritual instruction creates an atmosphere where faith becomes fun and accessible. This active form of worship helps build lasting foundations of faith while letting kids be kids – moving, laughing, and praising God with their entire being.

### Scripture
"Let them praise his name with dancing and make music to him with timbrel and harp." - Psalm 149:3

"David danced before the Lord with all his might." - 2 Samuel 6:14

## Worship Ideas
1. "Every Move I Make" - Have children follow simple motions: jumping during "Na na na," making wave motions for "waves of mercy," and spinning for "every move I make."

2. "This Little Light of Mine" - Add gestures like holding up pointer fingers as "lights," making circular motions for "all around the neighborhood," and covering/uncovering the "light."

3. "Jesus Loves Me" - Incorporate heart shapes with hands, pointing to self, and cross motions to reinforce the message.

### Devotional Thought
Just as David danced before the Lord with joy, God loves when we worship Him with our whole hearts and bodies. When we sing and dance for Jesus, we're showing Him how much we love Him, just like how we might run to give someone we love a big hug. God gave us our bodies, voices, and ability to move – using them to praise Him makes Him happy!

Prayer: "Dear Jesus, thank you for giving us music and dancing to praise you. Help us worship you with joy in everything we do. Amen."

### FAQs

**Q: What age group is best for worship songs with movements?**
A: Kids Christian songs with dance moves work well for children ages 2-12, but they're especially effective for preschool and elementary-aged children (3-10 years old). Adjust movements to match your group's coordination levels.

**Q: How can I teach new motions to a group of children?**
A: Start by demonstrating the moves slowly, break them into simple steps, and repeat them several times. Make it fun by letting kids help create new motions, and always celebrate their participation rather than perfection.

**Q: Where can I find good worship songs with movements?**
A: Look for resources from Christian children's music artists like Hillsong Kids, Yancy, and Go Fish. Many church curriculum providers also offer worship videos with motions. YouTube channels dedicated to children's ministry are another excellent source for action songs.
