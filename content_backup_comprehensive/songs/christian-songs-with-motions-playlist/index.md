# Christian Songs with Motions Playlist for Kids

### Introduction
Getting kids excited about worship through a Christian songs with motions playlist is one of the most effective ways to plant seeds of faith in young hearts. When children combine physical movement with praise, they engage multiple senses and create lasting spiritual memories. A carefully curated Christian songs with motions playlist helps kids express their love for Jesus while building biblical foundations through memorable lyrics and engaging actions. This dynamic approach to worship not only makes faith fun but also helps children internalize important truths about God's love and character. As parents and teachers, we have the wonderful opportunity to guide little ones in joyful, active worship that can shape their spiritual journey for years to come.

### Scripture
"Let them praise his name with dancing and make music to him with timbrel and harp." - Psalm 149:3

"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise." - Psalm 98:4

## Worship Ideas
1. "Every Move I Make" - Have kids jump during "na na na" and wave arms for "waves of mercy"
2. "This Little Light of Mine" - Hold up pointer finger as a candle, shine it everywhere, and hide it under hands for "won't let Satan blow it out"
3. "Jesus Loves Me" - Cross arms over chest for "loves," point up for "Jesus," and point to self for "me"

Make these motions simple and repetitive so kids can catch on quickly. Practice them yourself first, then demonstrate slowly before doing them at full speed.

### Devotional Thought
Just as we use our whole bodies to show excitement about our favorite things, we can use our entire selves to show God how much we love Him. When we jump, dance, and move in worship, we're telling Jesus that He makes us so happy we can't stay still! Remember, God gave us our bodies as instruments of praise.

Prayer: Dear Jesus, thank you for giving us songs to sing and ways to move as we worship You. Help us use our whole selves to show You how much we love You. Amen.
