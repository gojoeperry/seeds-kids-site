Kids hold up battery-operated tea lights or finger lights while singing, raising them high during the chorus and hiding them during "hide it under a bushel - NO!"

Use inflatable globes or blue and green paper circles as props while singing about God's care for creation.

### Devotional Thought
Just as birds wake up each morning singing their special songs, God gave us voices to praise Him too. When we sing together in worship, it's like joining a beautiful choir that God loves to hear. Every voice matters to Him - whether we sing perfectly or not. He simply loves hearing His children express their love through song.

Prayer: "Dear God, thank you for giving us songs to sing and voices to praise you. Help us make joyful noise for you today! Amen."
