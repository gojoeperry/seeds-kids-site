# Christian Songs With Motions With Lyrics

## Christian Songs with Motions with Lyrics for Kids

### Introduction
Teaching children to worship through Christian songs with motions with lyrics is a powerful way to help them connect with God while having fun. When kids combine physical movements with worship music, they engage multiple senses, making the experience more memorable and meaningful. These action-filled praise songs help children internalize biblical truths while expressing their love for Jesus in an age-appropriate way. As parents and teachers, incorporating Christian songs with motions with lyrics into your daily routine or Sunday school lessons creates an environment where children can freely express their faith through movement and song. This dynamic approach to worship not only keeps young ones engaged but also helps them remember important spiritual concepts through repetition and physical activity.

### Scripture
"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise." - Psalm 98:4

"Let everything that has breath praise the Lord. Praise the Lord!" - Psalm 150:6

## Worship Ideas
1. "This Little Light of Mine"
- "Hold up pointer finger as a "light"
- "Circle around while "letting it shine"
- "Hide hands behind back for "won't let Satan blow it out"

2. "Jesus Loves Me"
- "Cross arms over chest for "loves"
- "Point up for "Jesus"
- "Make a book shape with hands for "Bible"

3. "Deep and Wide"
- "Stretch arms wide for "wide"
- "Point down low for "deep"
- "Make fountain motions for "fountain flowing"

### Devotional Thought
Just as our bodies can move and dance, our hearts can move with love for Jesus. When we sing and do motions, we're using our whole selves to show God how much we love Him. Jesus wants us to come to Him like little children, full of joy and enthusiasm. Remember, worship isn't just about singing â€“ it's about showing God our love in every way we can.

Dear Jesus, thank you for giving us voices to sing and bodies to move in worship to you. Help us praise you with all our heart. Amen.

### FAQs

**What age group is best for action songs in worship?**
Action songs are particularly effective for children ages 2-10, but can be enjoyed by all ages. Younger children (2-5) typically love simple motions, while older kids (6-10) can handle more complex movements and longer lyrics.

**How can I teach new motions to a group of children?**
Start by breaking down the motions into simple steps, demonstrating them slowly without music first. Then add the words, and finally the music. Practice one section at a time, and use lots of repetition. Make it fun and don't worry about perfection!

**Where can I find good Christian action songs for kids?**
You can find Christian songs with motions on YouTube channels like Kids Worship Songs, in children's ministry curriculum materials, or through Christian music publishers like Lifeway Kids. Many churches also offer downloadable resources or DVDs specifically designed for children's worship.
