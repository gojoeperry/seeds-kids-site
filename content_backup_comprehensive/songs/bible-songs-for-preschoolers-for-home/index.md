Prayer: "Dear Jesus, thank you for giving us songs to sing about your love. Help us make joyful music for you every day. Amen."

### FAQs

### What age should I start teaching Bible songs to my child?
You can start introducing Bible songs as early as infancy! Babies respond to melodies and rhythm, and even if they can't sing along yet, they're absorbing the music and message. Most children begin actively participating in songs between ages 2-4.

### How can I make Bible songs more engaging for my preschooler?
Add movement, props, and repetition to keep young children engaged. Use hand motions, dance moves, or simple instruments. Make it interactive by letting them choose songs or create their own motions. Keep sessions short (10-15 minutes) and energetic.

### Where can I find good Bible songs for preschoolers?
Look for Christian children's music on streaming platforms, YouTube Kids channels, or Christian bookstores. Popular artists like Yancy, Seeds Family Worship, and The Donut Man offer quality, biblically-based children's music. Your local church's children's ministry may also have recommended resources.
