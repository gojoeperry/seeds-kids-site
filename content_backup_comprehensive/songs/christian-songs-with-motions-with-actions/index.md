# Christian Songs with Motions and Actions for Kids

### Introduction
Teaching children Christian songs with motions and actions is a powerful way to help them connect with God through worship. When kids combine singing with physical movements, they engage multiple senses, making the learning experience more memorable and meaningful. These interactive worship songs help young hearts absorb biblical truths while having fun and expressing their love for Jesus. Christian songs with motions and actions also help children release energy in a positive way while building their faith foundation. As parents and teachers, incorporating movement into worship time creates an engaging environment where kids can authentically express their faith and develop a lifelong love for praising God.

### Scripture
"Let them praise his name with dancing and make music to him with timbrel and harp." - Psalm 149:3

"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise." - Psalm 98:4

## Worship Ideas
1. "This Little Light of Mine" - Have children hold up one finger as their "light" and move it according to the lyrics (hide it under a bushel-no!, let it shine, all around the neighborhood).

2. "Jesus Loves Me" - Teach simple sign language for key words like "Jesus," "loves," and "Bible." Children can also cross arms over their chest during "loves."

3. "Father Abraham" - This classic action song gets everyone moving with arm motions, leg movements, and turning around, perfect for high-energy worship.

### Devotional Thought
Just as our whole body can praise God through songs and movements, Jesus wants our whole heart to love and follow Him. When we worship with actions, we're showing God that we love Him with everything we have - our voice, our hands, our feet, and our heart. God loves to see His children express joy in worship!

Prayer: "Dear Jesus, thank you for giving us ways to praise you with our whole body. Help us worship you with joy and love. Amen."

### FAQs

**What age group is best for action songs in worship?**
Action songs work well for children ages 2-12, but they're especially effective for preschool and elementary-age kids (3-8 years old). Younger children naturally learn through movement, while older kids can grasp deeper meanings behind the actions.

**How can I teach new motions to a group of children?**
Start by demonstrating the actions slowly while explaining them. Break down complex movements into simple steps. Practice the motions first without music, then add the song. Remember to be enthusiastic and patient - children feed off your energy!

**Where can I find resources for Christian action songs?**
You can find Christian songs with motions on YouTube channels dedicated to children's worship, Christian streaming platforms, or through children's ministry curriculum providers. Many churches also offer DVD resources or online tutorials for popular action songs.
