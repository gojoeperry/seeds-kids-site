### Scripture
"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise." - Psalm 98:4

"Let everything that has breath praise the Lord. Praise the Lord!" - Psalm 150:6

## Worship Ideas
1. "Yeshu Enne Snehikunnu" (Jesus Loves Me): Children form heart shapes with hands while singing, then point to themselves during "enne." Jump with joy during the chorus.

2. "Devan Nallavan" (God is Good): Kids can march in place, clap hands, and turn around during different verses. Add simple Malayalam words with corresponding actions like pointing up for "Devan" (God).

3. "Hallelujah Paduvin" (Sing Hallelujah): Create a circle, hold hands, and walk clockwise while singing. During the chorus, raise hands and twirl.

### Devotional Thought

When we sing and move together, we remind ourselves that worship isn't just about words - it's about expressing our joy in the Lord through everything we do.

Dear Jesus, help us worship You with all our heart. Thank You for giving us songs and movements to praise Your name. Amen.
