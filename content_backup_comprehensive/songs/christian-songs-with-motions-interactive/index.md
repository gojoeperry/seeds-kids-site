### Scripture
"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise." - Psalm 98:4

"Let them praise his name with dancing and make music to him with timbrel and harp." - Psalm 149:3

## Worship Ideas
1. "Jesus' Love is Bubbling Over" - Have kids crouch down low and slowly rise while wiggling fingers, then "bubble over" with raised arms and jumping.

2. "This Little Light of Mine" - Use finger motions for the light, hiding under a bushel, and letting it shine. Add walking in place and turning around.

3. "Father Abraham" - The classic motion song with marching, right arm, left arm, right foot, left foot, chin up, turn around, and sit down!

### Devotional Thought

Prayer: Dear Jesus, thank you for giving us music and movement to praise you. Help us worship you with joy and freedom. Amen.
