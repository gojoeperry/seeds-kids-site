# Christian Songs with Motions for Worship: Engaging Kids in Praise

### Introduction
Teaching children christian songs with motions for worship creates an engaging and memorable way for young hearts to connect with God. When kids combine physical movement with praise, they experience worship with their whole being, making spiritual truths more meaningful and lasting. These interactive worship experiences help children express their faith naturally while building a foundation for lifelong spiritual growth.

Including christian songs with motions for worship in your children's ministry or family devotion time helps kids understand that praising God can be both reverent and joyful. Through movement and music, children learn to express their love for Jesus in ways that match their natural enthusiasm and energy. This active worship approach helps them internalize biblical truths while creating precious memories of faith-filled moments.

### Scripture
"Let them praise his name with dancing and make music to him with timbrel and harp." - Psalm 149:3

"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise." - Psalm 98:4

## Worship Ideas
1. "Every Move I Make" - Children follow simple hand motions showing God's presence all around them, reaching high and low while singing about God's love.

2. "This Little Light of Mine" - Kids hold up pointer fingers as "lights," making circular motions and hiding their lights under imaginary bushels.

3. "Father Abraham" - A classic action song where children move their arms, legs, and whole bodies while singing about Abraham's faithfulness.

### Devotional Thought
Just as our bodies can move and dance, our hearts can also move closer to God through worship. When we sing and make motions, we're showing God that we love Him with everything we have - our voices, our bodies, and our hearts. Jesus loves to see His children worship with such joy and freedom!

Prayer: "Dear Jesus, thank you for giving us music and movement to praise you. Help us worship you with all our heart, mind, and strength. Amen."

### FAQs

### What age group is best for worship songs with motions?
Motion songs work well for children ages 2-12, but they're especially effective for preschool and elementary-age kids (3-8 years old). Younger children naturally connect with movement, while older kids can help lead and mentor younger ones.

### How can I teach new motions to a group of children?
Start by demonstrating the motions slowly without music. Break down complex movements into simple steps. Practice a few times, then add the music gradually. Remember to keep it fun and encourage participation without pressure.

### Where can I find good worship songs with motions?
You can find excellent resources through Christian children's ministry websites, YouTube channels like KidSpring and Seeds Family Worship, or children's worship curriculum providers. Many churches also offer motion song training videos and resources for family worship time.
