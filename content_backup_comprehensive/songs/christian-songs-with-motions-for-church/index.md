# Christian Songs With Motions For Church

# Christian Songs with Motions for Church: Engaging Kids in Active Worship

### Introduction
Teaching children Christian songs with motions for church creates an engaging and memorable worship experience that helps build their faith foundation. When kids combine physical movements with biblical truths through music, they're more likely to remember and internalize these important messages. Christian songs with motions for church aren't just entertaining â€“ they're powerful tools that help children express their love for God while learning key spiritual concepts.

Movement-based worship allows children to participate with their whole bodies, making the experience more meaningful and fun. It also helps channel their natural energy into positive expressions of praise. Whether you're a Sunday School teacher, children's ministry leader, or parent, incorporating action songs into worship time creates lasting spiritual memories and helps develop a joy-filled approach to praising God.

### Scripture
"Let them praise his name with dancing and make music to him with timbrel and harp." - Psalm 149:3

"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise." - Psalm 98:4

## Worship Ideas
1. "Every Move I Make" - Children follow simple hand motions showing God's presence all around them, reaching high and low while singing about God's love.

2. "This Little Light of Mine" - Kids hold up pointer fingers like candles, moving them in different directions while learning about sharing God's light.

3. "Father Abraham" - This classic action song gets everyone moving with increasingly complex motions, teaching about faith and God's family.

### Devotional Thought
Just as our bodies can move and dance, God wants our whole hearts to be filled with joy when we worship Him. Jesus loves seeing children praise Him with enthusiasm and energy! When we use our bodies to worship, we're showing God that we love Him with everything we have.

Prayer: "Dear Jesus, thank you for giving us songs to sing and ways to move while we worship you. Help us remember that you love seeing us praise you with joy. Amen."

### FAQs
Q: What age group is best for worship songs with motions?

Q: How can I teach new motions to a group of children?
A: Start by demonstrating the motions slowly without music, then add the words. Break down complex movements into simple steps. Practice a few times before adding music, and always encourage participation without pressure.

A: Many resources are available through Christian children's ministry websites, YouTube channels like Seeds Family Worship or Yancy Ministries, and curriculum providers such as Orange or Group Publishing.
