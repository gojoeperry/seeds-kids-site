## Bible Nursery Rhymes Lyrics for Christian Children

### Introduction
Bible nursery rhymes lyrics offer a delightful way to introduce young children to God's Word through familiar melodies and simple verses. These sacred adaptations of classic nursery rhymes help plant seeds of faith in little hearts while making biblical truths memorable and fun. By incorporating Bible nursery rhymes lyrics into daily routines, parents and teachers can create meaningful worship experiences that children eagerly anticipate. These special songs combine the comfort of traditional nursery rhymes with powerful spiritual messages, helping establish a strong foundation of faith from the earliest years. Whether sung at bedtime, during Sunday School, or throughout the day, Bible nursery rhymes lyrics make Scripture come alive for little ones.

### Scripture
"Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it." - Proverbs 22:6

"Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these." - Mark 10:14

## Worship Ideas
1. "Jesus Loves Me" with Sign Language: Teach simple hand motions to accompany each phrase, helping children connect movement with meaning.

2. "This Little Light of Mine" Circle Time: Have children sit in a circle passing a battery-operated candle while singing, emphasizing how we share God's love.

3. "The B-I-B-L-E" Action Song: Create movements for spelling out each letter, making it interactive and memorable for young learners.

### Devotional Thought
Just as Mary had a little lamb, Jesus is our Good Shepherd who loves and cares for each of us. He watches over us, guides us, and keeps us safe. When we sing these special rhymes, we're reminding ourselves of His endless love and care.

Dear Jesus, thank you for being our Good Shepherd. Help us remember your love as we sing these special songs. Amen.
