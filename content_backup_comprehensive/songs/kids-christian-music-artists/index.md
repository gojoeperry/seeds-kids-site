# Popular Kids Christian Music Artists for Young Worship

### Introduction
Kids Christian music artists play a vital role in helping children develop a strong foundation of faith through engaging, age-appropriate worship. These talented musicians create songs that speak directly to young hearts while teaching biblical truths in memorable ways. From upbeat praise songs to gentle lullabies, today's kids Christian music artists understand how to connect with children through relatable lyrics and catchy melodies.

The right worship music can make biblical concepts come alive and give kids a fun, meaningful way to express their love for God.

### Scripture
"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise." - Psalm 98:4

"Let everything that has breath praise the Lord. Praise the Lord!" - Psalm 150:6

## Worship Ideas
- "Create a "Praise Parade" where kids march around the room with musical instruments while singing their favorite worship songs"
- "Play "Freeze Dance Praise" - dance while the music plays, then freeze in a praise pose when it stops"
- "Learn simple hand motions to popular kids worship songs like "Every Move I Make" or "Jesus Loves Me"
- "Make homemade instruments from household items and form a family worship band"

### Devotional Thought
Just as birds sing beautiful songs to express their joy, God gave us voices to sing His praises. When we worship with music, we're sharing our love for God in a special way that makes His heart happy. Jesus loves to hear children's voices lifted in praise, just as He welcomed the children who came to Him in the Bible.

Dear God, thank you for giving us music to praise You. Help us use our voices to show Your love to others. Amen.
