3. "Standing Strong Like Daniel" march: Lead children in marching in place while singing about choosing to follow God, emphasizing Daniel's brave choices.

### Devotional Thought
Just like Daniel chose to be faithful to God even when it was hard, we can choose to follow God today. Sometimes our friends might want us to do things that don't please God, but we can be brave like Daniel and make good choices. God took care of Daniel, and He takes care of us too!
