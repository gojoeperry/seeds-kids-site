### Devotional Thought
Just as birds sing their beautiful songs each morning, God gives us voices to sing His praises too! When we sing about God's love, we're telling Him "thank you" for all His blessings and sharing His joy with others. Jesus loves to hear children worship Him – remember how He welcomed the little children and blessed them? Our songs make Him smile!

Dear God, thank you for music and for giving us voices to praise You. Help us share Your love through our songs. Amen.
