2. "This Little Light of Mine"

### Devotional Thought
Just as God made our bodies to move and dance, He loves when we use our whole selves to worship Him. Jesus welcomed little children and wants them to come to Him with joy and excitement. When we sing and move in worship, we're showing God how happy we are to be His children. Every jump, clap, and dance move can be a way to say "I love you" to Jesus.

Prayer: "Dear Jesus, thank you for making us able to move and sing. Help us worship you with happy hearts. Amen."
