### Devotional Thought
God loves to hear children worship! Just like parents smile when their children sing, our Heavenly Father delights in hearing young voices lifted in praise. Jesus welcomed children and said we should have faith like them. When we worship with pure hearts like little children, we bring joy to God's heart.

Dear God, thank you for loving our praise. Help us to sing with joy and teach our children to worship you with all their hearts. Amen.
