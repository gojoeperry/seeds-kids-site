# Scripture Songs Of Praise

## Scripture Songs of Praise: Teaching Kids to Worship Through God's Word

### Introduction
Teaching children scripture songs of praise is one of the most powerful ways to plant God's Word deeply in their hearts. When biblical truths are set to memorable melodies, kids naturally absorb and retain these precious teachings while experiencing the joy of worship. Scripture songs of praise combine the power of music with the truth of God's Word, creating an engaging way for children to learn, remember, and celebrate their faith. Research shows that children retain information much more effectively when it's set to music, making these songs an invaluable tool for spiritual development. As parents and teachers, we can use scripture songs of praise to create meaningful worship experiences that will stay with our children throughout their lives.

### Scripture
"Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom, singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, with thankfulness in your hearts to God." - Colossians 3:16

"Make a joyful noise to the Lord, all the earth! Serve the Lord with gladness! Come into his presence with singing!" - Psalm 100:1-2

## Worship Ideas
1. Scripture Memory Motions: Create simple hand motions to accompany key phrases in scripture songs. For example, point up for "God," cross arms over heart for "love," and spread arms wide for "everyone."

2. Bible Verse Echo: Split children into two groups, having them echo scripture phrases back and forth in a musical way. Add simple percussion instruments for extra engagement.

3. Scripture Song Drawing: While listening to scripture songs, have children draw pictures representing the biblical truths they're singing about.

### Devotional Thought
Just as God's Word is like food for our spirits, scripture songs of praise are like spiritual snacks that feed our hearts with truth. When Jesus walked on earth, He often quoted scripture because He knew how important God's Word is. When we sing these truths, we're following His example and hiding God's Word in our hearts.

Dear God, thank you for giving us your Word and the gift of music. Help us to praise you with joy as we learn more about who you are. Amen.
