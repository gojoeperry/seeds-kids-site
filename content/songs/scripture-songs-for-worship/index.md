# Scripture Songs For Worship

## Scripture Songs for Worship: Teaching Kids God's Word Through Music

### Introduction
Teaching children scripture songs for worship is one of the most powerful ways to plant God's Word deeply in their hearts. When Bible verses are set to engaging melodies, they become memorable tools that kids can carry with them throughout their lives. Scripture songs for worship do more than just help with memorization - they create a joyful atmosphere where children can experience God's presence while learning His truths. As parents and teachers, we have the wonderful opportunity to use music to help our little ones hide God's Word in their hearts from an early age. When kids learn to worship through scripture songs, they develop a natural connection between God's Word, music, and their daily walk with Jesus.

### Scripture
"Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom, singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, with thankfulness in your hearts to God." - Colossians 3:16

"I have hidden your word in my heart that I might not sin against you." - Psalm 119:11

## Worship Ideas
1. "Bible Verse Echo" - Sing a scripture verse line by line, having children echo each phrase while doing simple hand motions. For example, use arm movements to show "high" and "low" while singing Psalm 139:8.

2. "Scripture Memory Freeze Dance" - Play upbeat scripture songs and have kids dance, then freeze when the music stops to shout out the Bible reference together.

3. "Verse-in-Motion" - Create simple sign language or motion patterns for key words in the verse, helping kinesthetic learners connect with the message.

### Devotional Thought
Just as God sings over us with joy (Zephaniah 3:17), we can sing His Words back to Him in worship. When we learn scripture through songs, we're filling our hearts with treasures that the Holy Spirit can bring to mind exactly when we need them. God loves to hear children's voices lifted in praise, especially when they're declaring His truth through Scripture.

Prayer: "Dear Jesus, thank you for giving us your Word and for the gift of music. Help us to learn your truth through songs and keep these verses in our hearts forever. Amen."
