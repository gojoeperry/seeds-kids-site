# What Rock Song Has A Kids Choir?

# What Rock Song Has a Kids Choir? Inspiring Young Worship Leaders

### Introduction
Ever wondered "what rock song has a kids choir?" While songs like Pink Floyd's "Another Brick in the Wall" and The Who's "Tommy" famously feature children's choirs, there's something especially powerful about kids lifting their voices in worship. When young voices join together in praise, they create a pure, authentic sound that touches hearts and honors God in a unique way. Children's choirs in worship settings help develop musical skills, build confidence, and create lasting spiritual foundations. Whether you're leading worship at church, teaching Sunday School, or encouraging worship at home, incorporating kids' choir elements can transform ordinary songs into extraordinary expressions of faith.

### Scripture
"Out of the mouth of babes and nursing infants You have ordained strength" (Psalm 8:2)

"Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these." (Matthew 19:14)

## Worship Ideas
1. Create a "Living Choir" where kids stand in different positions to represent musical notes while singing
2. Use hand motions and body percussion to add rhythm to familiar worship songs
3. Form small choir groups where children can take turns leading different parts of songs

Consider teaching simple harmonies or echo parts to make songs more engaging. Even simple songs like "Jesus Loves Me" can become powerful when sung by a children's choir with creative arrangements.

### Devotional Thought
Just as each voice in a choir brings its unique sound, God created each child with special gifts to praise Him. When we sing together, we're like the different parts of the body of Christ working in harmony. Even if we're not perfect singers, God delights in our joyful noise!

Prayer: "Dear God, thank you for giving us voices to praise you. Help us use our gifts to bring glory to your name. Amen."

### FAQs

Q: What age should children start participating in worship choir?
A: Children can start participating in choir activities as young as age 4. However, structured choir programs typically work best with children ages 6 and up who can follow directions and maintain focus longer.

Q: How can I encourage my shy child to join in worship singing?
A: Start small by singing together at home, use fun motions, and never force participation. Gradually introduce group settings and celebrate their small steps toward involvement. Remember that some children prefer to worship in quieter ways.

Q: Where can I find kid-friendly worship choir resources?
A: Check Christian bookstores, websites like WorshipTogether Kids or KidsWorshipSongs.com, and your local church's children's ministry. Many publishers offer specialized curriculum for children's choir programs with age-appropriate arrangements and teaching materials.
