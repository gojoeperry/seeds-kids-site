God loves to hear children worship! Just like a parent delights in hearing their child sing, our Heavenly Father rejoices when we praise Him. Worship isn't about being perfect - it's about expressing our love for God from our hearts. Even Jesus welcomed children to come to Him, showing us that young voices matter in God's kingdom.

Dear God, thank you for loving our praise. Help us worship you with joy and truth. Amen.
