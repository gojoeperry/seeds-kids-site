# Kids Devotional Songs For Toddlers

## Kids Devotional Songs for Toddlers: Growing Little Hearts in Worship

### Introduction
Introducing kids devotional songs for toddlers is one of the most beautiful ways to plant seeds of faith in young hearts. During these formative years, toddlers are like sponges, eagerly absorbing everything around them, making it the perfect time to introduce them to worship through music. These simple, engaging songs help create a foundation of faith that can last a lifetime. When we incorporate kids devotional songs for toddlers into daily routines, we're not just teaching them melodies â€“ we're helping them develop a natural connection with God. The combination of music, movement, and biblical truth creates memorable experiences that shape their spiritual journey from the very beginning.

### Scripture
"Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these." - Matthew 19:14

"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth." - Psalm 100:1

## Worship Ideas
1. "Jesus Loves Me" with hand motions: Create heart shapes with hands during "loves me" and point up for "Jesus"

2. "This Little Light of Mine" action song: Hold up pointer fingers as "lights" and wave them while singing, hide them behind backs for "hide it under a bushel"

3. "God Made Me" body parts song: Touch head, shoulders, knees while singing about how God created each part of us

### Devotional Thought
God loves to hear children worship! Just like parents delight in hearing their toddlers learn new words, our Heavenly Father delights in hearing little ones sing His praises. When we worship with our toddlers, we're showing them that God is part of our everyday lives and that He cares about even the smallest details.

Prayer: "Dear Jesus, thank you for giving us songs to sing. Help us make joyful noise for you! Amen."

### FAQs

### What age should I start teaching devotional songs to my child?
You can start introducing devotional songs as early as infancy. Babies respond to melodies from birth, and by 12-18 months, many toddlers will attempt to sing along and do motions. The key is choosing age-appropriate songs with simple words and repetitive phrases.

### How can I make devotional songs more engaging for my active toddler?
Incorporate movement and props into your singing time. Use stuffed animals, puppets, or musical instruments. Create simple hand motions or dance moves that match the lyrics. Make it a fun, interactive experience rather than expecting them to sit still.

### Where can I find good devotional songs for toddlers?
Look for Christian children's music on platforms like YouTube Kids or Spotify Kids. Christian bookstores often have CDs designed for toddlers. Many churches also provide resources through their children's ministry programs. Popular artists like Yancy, Seeds Family Worship, and Cedarmont Kids offer excellent toddler-friendly worship music.
