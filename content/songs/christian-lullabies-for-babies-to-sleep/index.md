These gentle melodies, combined with sacred lyrics, help establish a foundation of spiritual nurture from the earliest days.

2. "The Lord is My Shepherd" Bedtime Melody: Hum or sing a gentle version of Psalm 23, incorporating soft patting or back rubbing
3. Prayer Song Time: Create a simple melody using your child's name and blessing words like "Jesus loves [child's name], yes He does, angels watch over you tonight"

### Devotional Thought
Just as we find peace and rest in quiet moments with Jesus, babies can experience His calming presence through gentle worship. God's love surrounds us even as we sleep, keeping us safe and secure. When we sing these lullabies, we're reminding our little ones that they are precious to Jesus and always in His care.

Prayer: "Dear Jesus, thank you for watching over our little ones as they sleep. Fill their dreams with Your peace and love. Amen."
