### Scripture
"Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these." - Matthew 19:14

"When you lie down, you will not be afraid; when you lie down, your sleep will be sweet." - Proverbs 3:24

## Worship Ideas
1. "Jesus Loves Me" with gentle swaying motions while holding your child
2. "He's Got the Whole World in His Hands" with soft hand movements showing God holding the world
3. Create a bedtime blessing routine: sing a short praise chorus, then pray together while holding hands

Make these moments special by dimming lights, using soft voices, and maintaining a peaceful environment that helps children associate worship with comfort and security.

### Devotional Thought
Just as we rest peacefully knowing our earthly parents are watching over us, we can rest in knowing our heavenly Father never sleeps and always keeps us safe. God's love is like a warm blanket that covers us all night long. When we sing lullabies about Jesus, we're reminding ourselves of His constant presence and care.

Dear God, thank you for watching over us while we sleep. Help us remember you are always near. Amen.
