# Kids Praise Songs CD: Growing Young Hearts Through Worship

### Introduction
Introducing your children to worship through a kids praise songs CD can be one of the most powerful ways to nurture their spiritual growth. These specially crafted collections combine catchy melodies with biblical truth, making it easy and fun for little ones to connect with God. Whether you're driving to school, having quiet time at home, or leading children's church, a quality kids praise songs CD provides the perfect soundtrack for spiritual development. The repetitive nature of praise songs helps children memorize Scripture and important faith concepts while they sing along. As parents and teachers, we have the incredible opportunity to shape young hearts through music that celebrates God's love and teaches foundational truths in age-appropriate ways.

### Scripture
"Let everything that has breath praise the Lord!" (Psalm 150:6)
"Make a joyful noise to the Lord, all the earth!" (Psalm 100:1)

## Worship Ideas
1. "Jesus Loves Me Rock" - Have kids hop on one foot during verses and jump with both feet during the chorus while singing
2. "Every Move I Make" - Create simple hand motions that follow the lyrics, having children mirror your movements
3. "Father Abraham" - This classic action song gets everyone moving and laughing while learning about faith

These songs work great for both home devotions and Sunday school settings, especially when you encourage children to express their worship through movement.

### Devotional Thought
Just like birds sing their beautiful songs to start each day, God loves to hear our voices lifted in praise. When we sing worship songs, we're telling God how much we love Him and thanking Him for all He's done. It doesn't matter if we're the best singers - what matters is that our hearts are full of joy for Jesus.

Prayer: "Dear God, thank you for giving us music to praise you. Help us remember that you love hearing our voices, whether we're singing loud or soft. Amen."
