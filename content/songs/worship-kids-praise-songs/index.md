# Teaching Kids to Worship Through Praise Songs

### Introduction
Worship kids praise songs provide a powerful way to help children connect with God through music and movement. When young hearts join together in worship, they learn essential truths about God's love while building a foundation for lifelong faith. These engaging songs combine simple melodies with biblical messages, making them perfect for helping kids express their love for Jesus. Whether used in Sunday School, children's church, or family devotion time, worship kids praise songs create memorable experiences that shape spiritual growth. By incorporating music, motion, and Scripture, these songs help children understand worship isn't just singing - it's giving their whole hearts to God. Parents and teachers can use these special praise songs to nurture a child's relationship with Jesus in an age-appropriate and joy-filled way.

### Scripture
"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise." - Psalm 98:4

"Let everything that has breath praise the Lord. Praise the Lord!" - Psalm 150:6

## Worship Ideas
1. "Jesus Loves Me Rock" - Add hand motions and body movements like jumping during the chorus. Kids can "rock out" while singing about Jesus's love.

2. "This Little Light of Mine" - Give children battery-operated tea lights to hold while singing. They can raise their lights high during "let it shine" and hide them during "don't let Satan blow it out."

3. "Lord I Lift Your Name on High" - Teach simple sign language motions to accompany the lyrics, helping kids connect physical movement with worship.

### Devotional Thought
God loves to hear children worship Him! Just like parents treasure hearing their children say "I love you," our Heavenly Father delights in our praise. When we worship, we're telling God how amazing He is and thanking Him for His love. Jesus said we should have faith like little children, and that includes worshiping with pure, honest hearts.

Prayer: "Dear Jesus, thank you for loving us. Help us worship you with all our hearts through songs and praise. We love you! Amen."
