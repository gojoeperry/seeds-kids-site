### Devotional Thought
Just as birds sing their special songs to express joy, God gave us voices to praise Him in our own unique way. When we worship through gospel music, we're telling God how much we love Him while sharing His joy with others. Jesus loves to hear children worship - remember how He welcomed the little children and how they shouted "Hosanna!" in the temple?

Prayer: "Dear Jesus, thank you for the gift of music. Help us use our voices and bodies to praise you with all our hearts. Make our worship bring you joy! Amen."
