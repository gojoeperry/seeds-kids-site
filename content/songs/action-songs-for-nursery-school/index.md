# Action Songs for Nursery School: Engaging Little Hearts in Worship

### Introduction
Action songs for nursery school children are a powerful way to combine movement, music, and meaningful worship experiences for our littlest learners. When young children participate in action songs, they engage their whole bodies in praise, making spiritual truths memorable and fun. These dynamic worship experiences help form the foundation of their faith journey, creating positive associations with church and Jesus from an early age.

Action songs for nursery school settings work especially well because they accommodate short attention spans and high energy levels while teaching biblical concepts through repetition and movement. Whether you're a parent, Sunday school teacher, or nursery worker, incorporating these songs into your routine can help children express their love for God while learning important truths about His character and love for them.

### Scripture
"Let everything that has breath praise the Lord!" (Psalm 150:6)
"Make a joyful noise to the Lord, all the earth!" (Psalm 100:1)

## Worship Ideas
1. "Jesus Loves Me" with Sign Language
- "Teach simple hand motions for "Jesus," "loves," and "me"
- "Add gentle swaying or marching in place"
- "End with big hugs to show God's love"

2. "If You're Happy and You Know It, Praise the Lord"
- "Replace traditional actions with worship moves"
- "Raise hands, jump for joy, twirl around"
- "Add "Jesus loves me" verse with heart motions"

3. "This Little Light of Mine"
- "Use finger motions for the "light"
- "March in place while singing"
- "Add simple dance moves during chorus"

### Devotional Thought
Just as our bodies can move and dance, our hearts can also jump for joy because of God's love. Jesus welcomes little children to come to Him, and He loves to hear their songs and see their happy movements. When we sing and move together, we're showing God how much we love Him, just like David danced before the Lord.

Prayer: "Dear Jesus, thank you for making us able to sing and dance for you. Help us to show your love through our songs and movements. Amen."

### FAQs

**What age group is best for action songs?**
Action songs are perfect for children ages 2-5, but can be adapted for both younger and older children. The key is to match the complexity of movements to the developmental stage of your group.

**How can I teach action songs to wiggly toddlers?**
Start with simple, repetitive motions and demonstrate them slowly. Break down the song into small parts, and don't worry if children don't follow exactly. The goal is joyful participation, not perfect execution.

**Where can I find more action songs for nursery school worship?**
Many Christian children's ministry websites offer free resources. Popular sources include YouTube channels dedicated to children's worship, Christian bookstores' children's music sections, and curriculum providers like Orange and Group Publishing.
