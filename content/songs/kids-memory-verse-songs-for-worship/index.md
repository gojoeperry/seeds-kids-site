Just like we enjoy singing our favorite songs over and over, God loves hearing our voices lifted in praise as we learn His Word. When we sing Scripture, we're not just memorizing - we're worshiping! Jesus often quoted Scripture, showing us how important it is to know God's Word by heart. Remember, every time you sing these verses, you're storing up treasures of truth that the Holy Spirit can bring to mind when you need them most.

Prayer: "Dear Jesus, thank you for giving us your Word and for fun ways to learn it. Help us hide your truth in our hearts through songs and worship. Amen."
