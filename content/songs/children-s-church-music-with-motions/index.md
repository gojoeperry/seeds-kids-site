# Children's Church Music with Motions: Engaging Kids in Worship

### Introduction
Children's church music with motions is a powerful way to help young hearts connect with God through joyful, active worship. When kids combine singing with physical movements, they engage multiple senses, making the worship experience more meaningful and memorable. These dynamic songs help children internalize biblical truths while expressing their love for God in an age-appropriate way. By incorporating children's church music with motions into your ministry or home worship time, you're creating an environment where kids can authentically worship while building lasting spiritual foundations. This active approach to worship helps children understand that praising God can be both reverent and fun, fostering a lifelong love for worship.

### Scripture
"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise." - Psalm 98:4

"Let everything that has breath praise the Lord. Praise the Lord!" - Psalm 150:6

## Worship Ideas
1. "My God Is So Big" - Have children stretch their arms wide for "big," make muscle arms for "strong," and point upward for "there's nothing my God cannot do."

2. "This Little Light of Mine" - Children hold up one finger as their "light," move it in circles, and hide it under their other hand for "hide it under a bushel."

3. "Jesus Loves Me" - Incorporate heart shapes with hands, cross motions, and gentle swaying while singing this beloved classic.

### Devotional Thought
Just as our bodies can dance and move to show joy, our hearts can dance with happiness because of God's love. When we worship with our whole selves - singing, moving, and praising - we're showing God how much we love Him. Jesus wants us to come to Him like little children, full of joy and trust.

Prayer: "Dear Jesus, thank you for giving us voices to sing and bodies to move in worship. Help us to praise you with all our heart. Amen."
