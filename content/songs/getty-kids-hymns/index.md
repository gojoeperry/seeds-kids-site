# Getty Kids Hymns: Building Faith Through Music

### Introduction
Getty Kids Hymns offer a beautiful way to introduce children to rich, theological truths through engaging and memorable music. These carefully crafted songs, created by Keith and Kristyn Getty, help young hearts connect with timeless Christian teachings in an age-appropriate way. When children learn Getty kids hymns, they're not just memorizing songs â€“ they're storing up biblical truth that can shape their faith for years to come. The combination of simple melodies and profound lyrics makes Getty kids hymns particularly effective for family worship, Sunday School, and daily Christian education. Parents and teachers appreciate how these songs build a strong foundation of faith while keeping children actively engaged in worship.

### Scripture
"Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom, singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, with thankfulness in your hearts to God." - Colossians 3:16

"Make a joyful noise to the Lord, all the earth! Serve the Lord with gladness! Come into his presence with singing!" - Psalm 100:1-2

## Worship Ideas
1. Create hand motions for "The Perfect Wisdom of Our God" - let kids design movements for key phrases
2. Use rhythm instruments while singing "Christ Our Hope in Life and Death" to keep young children engaged
3. Make a worship chain - write one line from a Getty kids hymn on each paper link, connecting them as you learn the song
