3. "Praise Party Freeze Dance" - Play upbeat worship songs and have kids dance, then freeze in a praise pose when the music stops.

### Devotional Thought
God delights in hearing children's voices lifted in praise. Just like parents love hearing their children sing, our Heavenly Father loves when we worship Him with joy and enthusiasm. Jesus said we should have faith like little children, and that includes praising Him with pure hearts and simple trust.

Prayer: "Dear God, thank you for giving us voices to sing and hearts to love you. Help us praise you with joy every day. Amen."

### FAQs

**What age should children start learning praise songs?**
Children can start learning praise songs as early as age 2-3. Even toddlers can clap, move, and begin memorizing simple lyrics. As they grow, they can participate in more complex songs and understand deeper meanings.

**How can I teach praise songs to children who are shy or reluctant?**
Start with simple, repetitive songs and use lots of encouragement. Include actions or instruments to make it fun and take pressure off singing. Let them watch others first and join in when comfortable. Never force participation â€“ enthusiasm often develops naturally.
