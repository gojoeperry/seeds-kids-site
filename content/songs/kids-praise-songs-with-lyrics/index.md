# Kids Praise Songs With Lyrics

## Teaching Kids Praise Songs with Lyrics

### Introduction
Introducing children to kids praise songs with lyrics is one of the most joyful and meaningful ways to nurture their spiritual growth. When young hearts learn to express worship through music, they develop a natural connection with God that can last a lifetime. Kids praise songs with lyrics help children understand biblical truths while creating fun, memorable experiences that make worship exciting and accessible. Whether you're a parent, Sunday school teacher, or children's ministry leader, incorporating praise songs into your teaching toolkit helps kids express their faith through movement, melody, and meaningful words. Research shows that children retain information better when it's set to music, making praise songs an excellent way to plant scripture and biblical principles in their hearts.

### Scripture
"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise." (Psalm 98:4)

"Let everything that has breath praise the Lord. Praise the Lord!" (Psalm 150:6)

## Worship Ideas
1. "Jesus Loves Me" with Sign Language
Teach simple hand motions for key words like "love," "Jesus," and "strong." Kids can sign while singing, engaging both body and voice.

2. "This Little Light of Mine" Action Song
Use finger motions for the "light," and encourage kids to move around during the "let it shine" chorus. Add verses about sharing God's love in different places.

3. "God Is So Good" Echo Song
Lead with one line at a time, having children repeat after you. Add simple percussion with hand claps or tambourines.

### Devotional Thought
God loves to hear children's voices raised in praise! Just like parents treasure hearing their children say "I love you," our Heavenly Father delights in our worship. When we sing praise songs, we're telling God how much we love Him and thanking Him for His goodness. Even Jesus welcomed children's praise when He was on earth.

Prayer: "Dear God, thank you for giving us voices to sing and hearts to love you. Help us worship you with joy every day. Amen."
