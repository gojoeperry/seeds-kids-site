Prayer: "Dear Jesus, thank you for giving us voices to sing and hearts to love you. Help us to worship you with joy every day. Amen."

### FAQs

**What age group are simple Sunday school worship songs best suited for?**
These songs are typically most effective for children ages 2-10, but can be adapted for any age. Younger children (2-5) especially benefit from songs with actions, while older kids (6-10) can handle more complex lyrics and concepts.

Break the song into small, manageable parts and teach them gradually. Start with the chorus, add movements first, then introduce verses one at a time. Keep sessions short and energetic, and always make it fun!
