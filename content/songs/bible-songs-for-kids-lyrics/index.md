### FAQs

### What age should children start learning Bible songs?
Children can start learning Bible songs from infancy! Even babies respond to gentle worship music, and toddlers naturally enjoy simple songs with motions. As children grow, they can gradually learn more complex songs and understand deeper meanings.

### How can I make Bible songs more engaging for my kids?
Add hand motions, use props like puppets or instruments, and incorporate movement. Let children help create their own motions or take turns leading. Make it interactive by asking questions about the lyrics and connecting them to Bible stories.
