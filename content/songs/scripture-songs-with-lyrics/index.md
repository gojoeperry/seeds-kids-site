# Scripture Songs With Lyrics

## Scripture Songs with Lyrics for Kids

### Introduction
Teaching children scripture songs with lyrics is one of the most powerful ways to help them hide God's Word in their hearts. When Bible verses are set to memorable melodies, kids naturally absorb and retain these precious truths while having fun. Scripture songs with lyrics combine the joy of music with the power of God's Word, creating an engaging way for children to learn biblical principles. As parents and teachers, we can use these musical tools to nurture our children's faith and help them build a strong spiritual foundation. Whether during family devotions, Sunday School, or casual moments throughout the day, teaching scripture through song creates lasting memories and deep spiritual roots.

### Scripture
"Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom, singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, with thankfulness in your hearts to God." - Colossians 3:16

"I have hidden your word in my heart that I might not sin against you." - Psalm 119:11

## Worship Ideas
1. "The B-I-B-L-E" with hand motions: Hold hands like an open book, point upward for "God," and march in place for "stand alone."

2. "Books of the Bible Song" using a bouncing ball: Bounce the ball on each book name to keep rhythm.

3. Create hand motions for short verse songs like "Jesus Loves Me" or "This is the Day," incorporating simple sign language gestures.

### Devotional Thought
Just as we enjoy singing our favorite songs over and over, God loves to hear His children sing His Word. When we sing scripture songs with lyrics, we're not just memorizing - we're worshiping! Jesus often quoted scripture, and when we learn Bible verses through song, we're following His example. 

Dear God, thank you for giving us music to help us learn Your Word. Help us to sing joyfully and remember Your truths in our hearts. Amen.
