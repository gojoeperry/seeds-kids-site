### Devotional Thought
God loves to hear children worship Him! Just like parents smile when their children sing, our Heavenly Father delights in hearing young voices lifted in praise. Jesus said to let the little children come to Him, and worship songs are a beautiful way for children to draw near to God's heart.

Dear God, thank you for giving us songs to sing. Help us praise you with joy in our hearts. Amen.

### FAQs

### What age should children start learning worship songs?
Children can start learning worship songs as early as 18 months old. At this age, they naturally respond to music and can begin mimicking simple motions. By age 2-3, most preschoolers can learn short phrases and participate more actively in worship.

### How can I make worship time more engaging for my preschooler?
Make worship interactive by adding hand motions, incorporating simple instruments, and choosing songs with repetitive phrases. Keep sessions short (5-10 minutes), use visual aids when possible, and celebrate their participation. Remember to model enthusiasm and joy while worshipping together.

### Where can I find good worship songs for preschoolers?
Look for age-appropriate worship songs on Christian children's YouTube channels, Christian streaming services, or children's ministry websites. Many churches also offer preschool worship resources through their children's ministry departments. Popular artists like Yancy, Seeds Family Worship, and Cedarmont Kids offer excellent preschool-friendly worship music.
