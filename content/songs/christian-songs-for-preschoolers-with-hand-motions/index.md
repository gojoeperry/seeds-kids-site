### Devotional Thought
Just as we use our whole bodies to praise God through songs and motions, Jesus wants all of us - our hearts, minds, and actions - to show His love to others. When we sing and move together, we're showing God how happy we are to be His children. Even the smallest hands can praise Him!

Prayer: "Dear Jesus, thank you for giving us songs to sing and ways to praise you with our whole bodies. Help us share your joy with everyone we meet. Amen."
