# Kids Christian Music Videos On Youtube

# Finding the Best Kids Christian Music Videos on YouTube

### Introduction
Looking for engaging kids Christian music videos on YouTube can feel overwhelming with so many options available. However, these musical resources are invaluable for helping children grow in their faith while having fun. Quality kids Christian music videos on YouTube combine catchy tunes, biblical truth, and engaging visuals that capture young hearts and minds. These videos provide an excellent way for parents and teachers to introduce worship, scripture memorization, and Christian values in an age-appropriate format that today's tech-savvy kids understand and enjoy.

When children engage with worship through music and movement, they're more likely to remember biblical truths and develop a genuine love for praising God. The combination of sight, sound, and motion creates powerful learning experiences that can shape their spiritual foundation for years to come.

### Scripture
"Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these." - Matthew 19:14

"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise." - Psalm 98:4

## Worship Ideas
1. "Bible Freeze Dance" - Play upbeat Christian songs and have kids dance, freezing when the music stops. During freeze moments, share quick Bible facts or verses.

2. "Follow the Leader Praise" - Choose videos with motion songs and create a line where kids follow a leader's movements while singing along.

3. "Scripture Sound-Off" - Select videos that teach Bible verses through song, encouraging children to echo phrases and do corresponding actions.

### Devotional Thought
Just as David danced before the Lord with all his might, God loves when we worship Him with our whole hearts. Whether we're singing, dancing, or just listening to worship music, Jesus delights in our praise. Remember that worship isn't about being perfect â€“ it's about showing God how much we love Him.

Dear God, thank you for giving us music to praise you. Help us to worship you with joy and teach others about your love through songs. Amen.

### FAQs

### What age group is best for YouTube Christian music videos?
Most Christian music videos for kids are designed for ages 2-12, but different channels target specific age ranges. For toddlers (2-4), look for simple songs with basic movements. Elementary-aged children (5-12) often enjoy more complex songs with biblical messages and choreography.

### How can I incorporate these videos into our daily routine?
Start by setting aside 10-15 minutes during morning routines or before bedtime. Use videos during family devotional time, while doing chores, or during Sunday school preparation. Make it interactive by learning the motions together and discussing the messages afterward.

### Where can I find safe, quality Christian music videos for kids?
Look for established Christian channels like Hillsong Kids, Seeds Family Worship, or Go Fish Kids. Always preview content first and consider creating a playlist of approved videos. Many church denominations also have their own YouTube channels with kid-friendly worship content.
