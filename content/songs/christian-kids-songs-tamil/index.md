# Christian Kids Songs Tamil: Growing Faith Through Music

### Introduction
Christian kids songs in Tamil provide a wonderful way to nurture children's faith while celebrating their cultural heritage. These melodious songs combine biblical truths with the rich musical traditions of Tamil culture, making spiritual learning both fun and meaningful. When children learn Christian kids songs in Tamil, they develop a deeper connection to their faith and language simultaneously. The rhythmic nature of Tamil Christian songs helps young ones remember important biblical principles while engaging their hearts in worship. Parents and teachers have found that these songs create an ideal foundation for spiritual education, as music has a unique way of embedding truth in young minds. Through Tamil Christian children's songs, kids can express their love for Jesus in their mother tongue while building a strong spiritual foundation.

### Scripture
"Let the message of Christ dwell among you richly as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom through psalms, hymns, and songs from the Spirit, singing to God with gratitude in your hearts." - Colossians 3:16

"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise." - Psalm 98:4

## Worship Ideas
1. "Yesu En Nathanai" (Jesus is My Lord) - Include hand motions pointing upward for "Yesu" and crossing arms over heart for "love"
2. "Devan Nallavar" (God is Good) - Create a simple circle dance where children can clap and move in rhythm
3. Action Song Time - Combine Tamil worship songs with body movements, like jumping when singing about joy or raising hands for praise

### Devotional Thought
Just as birds sing their beautiful songs each morning, God wants us to sing praises to Him in our own special way. When we sing Tamil Christian songs, we're telling Jesus how much we love Him in our own language. He understands every word and delights in hearing children worship Him.

Prayer: "Dear Jesus, thank you for giving us songs to sing. Help us praise you with joy in our hearts. Amen."
