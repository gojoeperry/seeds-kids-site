# Kids Praise Songs With Motions Lyrics

## Kids Praise Songs with Motions Lyrics: Making Worship Fun and Meaningful

### Introduction
Teaching kids praise songs with motions lyrics is one of the most effective ways to help children connect with God through worship. When children combine singing with physical movement, they engage multiple senses, making the worship experience more memorable and meaningful. Kids praise songs with motions lyrics help young ones express their joy and love for God while building important foundations of faith. Not only do these songs make worship fun and interactive, but they also help children memorize biblical truths and develop a natural, authentic approach to praising God. As parents and teachers, introducing these dynamic worship elements creates lasting spiritual memories and helps establish lifelong patterns of joyful worship.

### Scripture
"Let them praise his name with dancing and make music to him with timbrel and harp." - Psalm 149:3

"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise." - Psalm 98:4

## Worship Ideas
1. "Every Move I Make" - Have children jump on "move," wave arms for "waves of mercy," and spin for "in Your presence Lord"
2. "This Little Light of Mine" - Hold up pointer finger as "light," make circular motions for "all around the neighborhood," and cup hands around mouth for "don't let Satan blow it out"
3. "Father Abraham" - Incorporate full-body movements, adding new actions with each verse (right arm, left arm, right foot, left foot)

### Devotional Thought
Just as our bodies can dance and move to show happiness, our hearts can jump with joy when we praise God. Jesus loves to see children worship Him with their whole heart and body! When we sing and move in worship, we're showing God how much we love Him, just like David danced before the Lord. Remember, worship isn't about perfect movements or singing - it's about giving our best to God with joy.

Prayer: "Dear Jesus, thank you for the gift of music and movement. Help us worship you with all our heart, mind, and strength. Amen."

### FAQs
**What age group is best for motion worship songs?**
Motion worship songs work well for children ages 2-12, but can be adapted for any age. Younger children (2-5) do best with simple, repetitive motions, while older kids can handle more complex movements and longer songs.

**How can I teach new motions to a group of children?**
Start by breaking down the motions into simple steps, demonstrate them slowly, and practice without music first. Then add the music gradually, encouraging children to follow along. Remember to keep it fun and praise their efforts!

**Where can I find good kids worship songs with motions?**
You can find excellent resources through Christian children's ministries like Hillsong Kids, Yancy Ministries, and Go Fish. YouTube channels dedicated to children's worship also offer plenty of motion-based songs with visual demonstrations. Many churches also provide worship DVDs or online resources specifically designed for children's ministry.
