# Hymns Kids Should Know

# Hymns Kids Should Know: Building a Foundation of Faith Through Music

### Introduction
Teaching hymns kids should know is a vital part of nurturing their spiritual journey. These timeless songs carry deep theological truths that can shape a child's understanding of God from an early age. While contemporary worship music is wonderful, classic hymns provide a rich heritage of faith that connects children to generations of believers before them. When kids learn these hymns, they're not just memorizing songs â€“ they're absorbing foundational truths about God's character and His love. The hymns kids should know often contain powerful messages about faith, grace, and God's faithfulness that can serve as anchors throughout their lives. By introducing these songs early, we help children build a strong spiritual vocabulary and a deeper appreciation for worship.

### Scripture
"Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom, singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, with thankfulness in your hearts to God." - Colossians 3:16

"Make a joyful noise to the Lord, all the earth! Serve the Lord with gladness! Come into his presence with singing!" - Psalm 100:1-2

## Worship Ideas
- "Create hand motions for hymns like "Jesus Loves Me" or "Amazing Grace"
- "Use picture cards to illustrate key words in hymns, helping children understand their meaning"
- "Play "Hymn Charades" where kids act out words or phrases from familiar hymns"
- "Make a simple rhythm with clapping or percussion instruments while singing traditional hymns to keep children engaged"

### Devotional Thought
God gives us songs to help us remember His love and goodness. Just like David wrote psalms to praise God, we can use hymns to express our love for Him. When we sing these special songs, we're joining with Christians from all over the world and throughout history in praising our amazing God.

Dear God, thank you for giving us beautiful songs to sing. Help us learn these hymns and understand the wonderful things they tell us about You. Amen.

### FAQs
**What age should children start learning hymns?**
Children can start learning simple hymns as early as age 3 or 4. Start with easy, repetitive choruses and gradually introduce more complex hymns as they grow older. The key is to choose hymns with clear, understandable language and memorable melodies.

**How can I make hymn learning fun for kids?**
Make hymn learning interactive by adding motions, using pictures, or creating games. Break down difficult words and explain their meanings using examples from daily life. Consider teaching one hymn per month and incorporating it into regular family devotions or bedtime routines.

**Where can I find kid-friendly hymn resources?**
Look for children's hymnals at Christian bookstores or online retailers. Many websites offer free printable lyrics and sheet music. YouTube channels featuring children's versions of classic hymns can also be helpful. Your church's music ministry might have additional resources specifically designed for teaching hymns to children.
