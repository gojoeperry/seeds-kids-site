### Devotional Thought
Just as birds sing their beautiful songs to express joy, God gave us voices to sing His praises. When we sing about our faith, we're telling God how much we love Him and reminding ourselves of His wonderful promises. Jesus loves to hear children worship Him - remember how He welcomed the little children and said the kingdom of heaven belongs to them!

Prayer: "Dear Jesus, thank you for giving us songs to sing about your love. Help us use our voices to praise you and share your joy with others. Amen."
