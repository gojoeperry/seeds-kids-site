# Kids Church Music For Home

# Kids Church Music for Home: Creating Worship Moments with Your Children

### Introduction
Bringing kids church music for home worship creates powerful opportunities for children to connect with God in familiar surroundings. When families incorporate worship music into their daily routines, it helps build a foundation of faith that can last a lifetime. Kids church music for home use doesn't require special equipment or training – just willing hearts and joyful spirits. Whether you're a parent looking to enhance family devotional time or a teacher sharing resources with families, creating these musical moments helps children understand worship as a natural part of everyday life. By bringing kids church music into your home, you're teaching children that praising God isn't limited to Sunday mornings but can happen anywhere, anytime.

### Scripture
"Let everything that has breath praise the Lord!" (Psalm 150:6)
"Make a joyful noise to the Lord, all the earth!" (Psalm 100:1)

## Worship Ideas
1. Create a "Praise Parade" where kids march around the house with homemade instruments while singing familiar worship songs
2. Start a "Morning Melody" routine with a short worship song during breakfast
3. Use hand motions with songs like "Jesus Loves Me" or "This Little Light of Mine" to keep children engaged and active

Make sure to include plenty of movement and encourage children to create their own motions to express worship. Simple percussion instruments like wooden spoons or empty plastic containers can add excitement to the experience.

### Devotional Thought
Just as birds sing their beautiful songs to start each day, God loves to hear our voices lifted in praise. When we worship, we're telling God how much we love Him and thank Him for all He's done. Jesus said that God especially loves to hear children's praise (Matthew 21:16). Remember, your voice is special to God – He loves hearing you sing to Him!

Prayer: "Dear God, thank you for giving us music and voices to praise you. Help us remember to sing to you every day. Amen."

### FAQs

**What age should children start learning worship songs?**
Children can start learning worship songs as early as infancy! Even babies respond to music, and toddlers naturally love to sing and move. Start with simple songs and add more complex ones as they grow.

**How can I make worship time more engaging for my kids at home?**
Include movement, instruments, and variety in your worship time. Let children choose songs, create motions, and even make up their own worship songs. Keep sessions short (10-15 minutes) and make them fun and interactive.

**Where can I find good kids worship music resources?**
Many Christian music publishers offer children's worship albums and videos. Look for resources from Hillsong Kids, Seeds Family Worship, or GoFish. Many churches also share their children's ministry playlists, and platforms like YouTube have dedicated Christian children's music channels.
