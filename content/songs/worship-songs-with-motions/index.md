# Worship Songs With Motions

# Teaching Kids Worship Songs with Motions

### Introduction
Worship songs with motions are a powerful way to help children connect with God through music and movement. When kids combine simple actions with praise songs, they engage their whole bodies in worship, making the experience more meaningful and memorable. Research shows that children learn best through multi-sensory experiences, which is why worship songs with motions are so effective in helping them internalize biblical truths and express their love for God. Whether you're a parent, Sunday school teacher, or children's ministry leader, incorporating worship songs with motions into your spiritual teaching toolkit can transform how kids experience and understand worship. These songs create an atmosphere of joy and celebration while building a foundation of faith that can last a lifetime.

### Scripture
"Let them praise his name with dancing and make music to him with timbrel and harp." - Psalm 149:3

"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise." - Psalm 98:4

## Worship Ideas
1. "Every Move I Make" - Have children march in place during verses and jump during the chorus while singing about following Jesus.

2. "This Little Light of Mine" - Teach kids to hold up one finger as their "light," then add motions like hiding it under a basket or letting it shine all around the room.

3. "Father Abraham" - This classic action song gets kids moving with different body parts while learning about faith and God's promises.

### Devotional Thought
Just as our bodies can move and dance, our hearts can also move closer to God through worship. When we sing and make motions, we're using the amazing bodies God gave us to show Him how much we love Him. Jesus wants us to come to Him like little children - with joy, enthusiasm, and our whole hearts.

Prayer: Dear God, thank you for giving us voices to sing and bodies to move in worship to you. Help us remember that worship can be fun and full of joy. Amen.
