# Teaching Kids Christian Songs with Motions

### Introduction
Getting children excited about worship through Christian songs with motions with motions is one of the most effective ways to plant seeds of faith in young hearts. When kids combine physical movements with spiritual songs, they engage multiple senses, making the message more memorable and meaningful. These action-packed worship experiences help children express their love for Jesus while building important biblical foundations. Whether you're a parent, Sunday school teacher, or children's ministry leader, incorporating Christian songs with motions with motions into your teaching toolkit creates an environment where faith becomes active, joyful, and contagious. Not only do these songs make worship fun, but they also help children internalize scripture and important spiritual truths in ways that purely verbal instruction cannot achieve.

### Scripture
"Let them praise his name with dancing and make music to him with timbrel and harp." - Psalm 149:3

"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise." - Psalm 98:4

## Worship Ideas
1. "Every Move I Make" - Children stretch arms wide for "waves of mercy," jump for "waves of grace," and spin for God's love all around.

2. "This Little Light of Mine" - Hold up pointer fingers as "lights," hide them behind backs for "hide it under a bushel," and make wind-blowing motions for "won't let Satan blow it out."

3. "Father Abraham" - This classic action song gets everyone moving with right arm, left arm, right foot, left foot, chin up, turn around, and sit down!

### Devotional Thought
Just as our bodies can move and dance to show joy, our hearts can leap with happiness when we think about God's love. Jesus wants us to worship Him with our whole selves - not just our voices, but our actions too! When we sing and move together, we're showing God how much we love Him, just like David danced before the Lord.

Dear Jesus, thank you for giving us bodies that can move and voices that can sing. Help us worship you with joy and excitement. Amen.

### FAQs

**What age group is best for action songs?**
Action songs work well for children ages 2-12, but they're especially effective for preschool and elementary-aged kids (3-8 years old). Younger children love simple motions, while older kids can handle more complex movements and longer songs.

**How can I teach new motions effectively?**
Break down the movements into simple steps, demonstrate them slowly first, and then gradually increase speed. Start with hand motions before adding full body movements. Practice one section at a time, and always model enthusiasm - kids will mirror your energy!

**Where can I find good Christian action songs?**
Many resources are available! Check YouTube channels like Kids on the Move or Yancy Ministries, purchase DVDs from groups like Hillsong Kids or Go Fish, or explore Christian children's music streaming services. Many churches also offer free resources through their children's ministry departments.
