### Devotional Thought
Just as birds sing their beautiful songs each morning, God gave us voices to praise Him too! When we worship, we're telling God how much we love Him and thanking Him for all He's done. Jesus loves to hear children's voices lifted in praise â€“ remember how He welcomed the children and said the kingdom of heaven belongs to them?

Prayer: "Dear Jesus, thank you for giving us songs to sing and ways to praise you. Help us worship you with joy in our hearts. Amen."

A: Start by breaking down the song into small, manageable parts. Teach the chorus first, add motions gradually, and use lots of repetition. Make it fun by incorporating games or stories related to the song's message.

Q: Where can I find more sunday school worship songs and resources?
