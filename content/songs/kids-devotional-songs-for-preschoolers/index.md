# Kids Devotional Songs For Preschoolers

## Kids Devotional Songs for Preschoolers: Growing Young Hearts in Worship

### Introduction
Teaching kids devotional songs for preschoolers is one of the most precious ways to plant seeds of faith in young hearts. During these formative years, children are naturally drawn to music, making it the perfect vehicle for sharing God's love and truth. When preschoolers learn devotional songs, they're not just memorizing words â€“ they're building a foundation of faith that can last a lifetime. These simple melodies and movements help little ones express their love for Jesus in ways that match their developmental stage and endless energy. By incorporating kids devotional songs for preschoolers into daily routines, parents and teachers create joyful moments of worship that children eagerly anticipate and remember.

### Scripture
"Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these." - Matthew 19:14

"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth!" - Psalm 100:1

## Worship Ideas
1. "Jesus Loves Me" with Sign Language
   - "Teach basic signs for "Jesus," "loves," and "me"
   - "Add gentle swaying motions"

2. "This Little Light of Mine"
   - "Use finger motions for the "light"
   - "March in place during chorus"
   - "Hide and reveal "light" during verses"

### Devotional Thought
Jesus delights in children's worship! Just as parents smile when their little ones sing, our Heavenly Father loves hearing preschoolers praise Him. Every song, every movement, and every giggle is precious to God. He created music as a special gift to help us express our love for Him.

Dear Jesus, thank you for loving our preschoolers. Help them feel Your joy as they sing and dance for You. Amen.

### FAQs

### What age is best to start teaching devotional songs to children?
You can start introducing devotional songs as early as infancy! Babies and toddlers naturally respond to music, and by age 2-3, they can begin participating more actively in simple songs with motions. The key is choosing age-appropriate songs with repetitive phrases and easy movements.

### How can I make devotional songs more engaging for my preschooler?
Add visual aids like puppets or stuffed animals, incorporate hand motions or dance moves, and use simple instruments like tambourines or bells. Make it interactive by letting children suggest movements or take turns leading. Keep sessions short (10-15 minutes) and energetic.

### Where can I find good devotional songs for preschoolers?
Look for Christian children's music on platforms like YouTube Kids or Spotify's children's worship playlists. Many churches offer children's worship resources, and publishers like Seeds Family Worship and Yancy Ministries create excellent age-appropriate content. Local Christian bookstores often carry CDs and DVDs specifically designed for preschool worship.
