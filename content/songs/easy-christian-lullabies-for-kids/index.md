### Scripture
"When you lie down, you will not be afraid; when you lie down, your sleep will be sweet." - Proverbs 3:24

"Be still, and know that I am God." - Psalm 46:10

## Worship Ideas
1. "Jesus Loves Me" sung softly with gentle rocking motions
2. "He's Got the Whole World in His Hands" with quiet hand gestures
3. Create a bedtime blessing ritual: Make the sign of the cross on your child's forehead while singing "God is So Good"

Include soft background music and dim lighting to create a peaceful atmosphere. Keep movements minimal and gentle to promote relaxation.

### Devotional Thought
Just as loving parents tuck their children into bed each night, our Heavenly Father watches over us as we sleep. He never slumbers or sleeps, always keeping us safe in His care. This reminds us that we can trust God completely, just like children trust their parents at bedtime.

Prayer: "Dear Jesus, thank you for watching over me while I sleep. Help me rest peacefully, knowing you are always with me. Amen."
