# Kids Praise And Worship Songs List

# Kids Praise and Worship Songs List: Helping Children Connect with God

### Introduction
Creating a meaningful kids praise and worship songs list is essential for nurturing your child's spiritual journey. When children learn to express their love for God through music and movement, they develop a foundation of faith that can last a lifetime. The right kids praise and worship songs list can transform ordinary moments into sacred experiences, whether at home, Sunday school, or children's church. These songs help young hearts understand God's love while making worship fun and memorable. By introducing children to praise music early, we help them develop a natural, joyful approach to worshiping God that combines learning with celebration.

### Scripture
"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise." - Psalm 98:4

"Let everything that has breath praise the Lord. Praise the Lord!" - Psalm 150:6

## Worship Ideas
1. "Jesus Loves Me" with Sign Language
   - "Teach simple hand motions for key words"
   - "Add rhythm with clapping or tambourines"

2. "This Little Light of Mine"
   - "Use finger motions for the "light"
   - "March in place during chorus"
   - "Create a circle dance"

3. "Father Abraham"
   - "Perfect for getting wiggles out"
   - "Incorporate full-body movements"
   - "Great for group participation"

### Devotional Thought
Just as birds sing their beautiful songs each morning, God gave us voices to praise Him. When we worship, we're telling God how much we love Him and thanking Him for His goodness. Jesus loves to hear children's voices lifted in praise!

Prayer: "Dear Jesus, thank you for giving us songs to sing and ways to praise you. Help us to worship you with joy in our hearts. Amen."

### FAQs

### What age should children start learning worship songs?
Children can start learning worship songs as early as age 2! Simple songs with repetitive phrases and motions are perfect for toddlers, while older children can handle more complex lyrics and concepts. The key is choosing age-appropriate songs that match their understanding and attention span.

### How can I make worship time more engaging for kids?
Make worship interactive by adding hand motions, instruments, or dance moves. Use visual aids like pictures or puppets to illustrate song meanings. Create a regular worship routine, perhaps before bedtime or during family devotions. Most importantly, model enthusiasm and participation yourself!

### Where can I find good kids worship resources?
Look for resources from established Christian publishers like Hillsong Kids, Seeds Family Worship, or GoFish. Many churches offer children's worship albums, and platforms like YouTube have dedicated Christian children's music channels. Local Christian bookstores often carry kids' worship DVDs and CDs with accompanying motion guides.
