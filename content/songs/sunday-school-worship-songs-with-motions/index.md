# Sunday School Worship Songs with Motions: Engaging Kids in Praise

### Introduction
Getting children excited about worship is one of the most rewarding aspects of Sunday school ministry. Sunday school worship songs with motions are specially designed to capture young hearts and minds, helping kids express their love for God through both music and movement. When children engage in these interactive worship experiences, they're not just learning songs – they're building lasting spiritual foundations and creating joyful memories of praising God. Including motions with worship songs helps children remember lyrics better, understand biblical concepts more clearly, and stay focused during worship time. Whether you're a Sunday school teacher, parent, or children's ministry leader, incorporating sunday school worship songs with motions can transform your worship sessions into dynamic, meaningful experiences that kids look forward to each week.

### Scripture
"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise." - Psalm 98:4

"Let everything that has breath praise the Lord. Praise the Lord!" - Psalm 150:6

## Worship Ideas
1. "Jesus Loves Me" with Sign Language
- "Teach basic sign language for key words like "love," "Jesus," and "strong"
- "Add simple jumping motions during the chorus"

2. "This Little Light of Mine"
- "Hold up pointer fingers as "lights"
- "Make circular motions for "all around the neighborhood"
- "Cup hands over "light" when singing about not hiding it"

3. "Deep and Wide"
- "Spread arms for "wide"
- "Point downward for "deep"
- "Make wave motions for "fountain flowing"

### Devotional Thought
Just as our bodies can move and dance, our hearts can jump with joy for Jesus! When we worship with our whole selves – our voices, our hands, and our feet – we're showing God how much we love Him. Jesus loves to see children worship, and He smiles when we praise Him with all our heart.

Prayer: "Dear Jesus, thank you for giving us songs to sing and ways to move as we worship You. Help us to always praise You with joy. Amen."

### FAQs

### What age group is best for worship songs with motions?
Worship songs with motions work well for children ages 2-12, but they're especially effective for preschool through elementary age (3-10 years old). Younger children enjoy simple, repetitive motions, while older kids can handle more complex movements.

### How can I teach new motions to a group of children?
Start by breaking down the motions into simple steps, demonstrating them slowly without music first. Practice one section at a time, then gradually add the music. Make it fun by letting kids help create new motions and celebrating their participation.

### Where can I find good Sunday school worship songs with motions?
You can find excellent resources through Christian children's ministry websites, YouTube channels dedicated to kids' worship, and curriculum providers like Group Publishing or Orange. Many churches also share their children's worship resources online, and Christian bookstores often carry DVDs and song books with motion instructions.
