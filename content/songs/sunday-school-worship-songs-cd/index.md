# Sunday School Worship Songs Cd

# Teaching Kids to Worship with Sunday School Songs

### Introduction
A Sunday school worship songs CD can be one of the most powerful tools for nurturing your child's faith journey. When children learn to express their love for God through music, they develop a foundation for lifelong worship that goes beyond mere entertainment. The right Sunday school worship songs CD combines fun, biblical truth, and memorable melodies that help kids internalize important spiritual concepts. Today's worship resources for children are more engaging than ever, featuring upbeat tunes and interactive elements that make praising God naturally appealing to young hearts. By introducing children to worship music early, we help them understand that connecting with God can be both meaningful and enjoyable.

### Scripture
"Let everything that has breath praise the Lord. Praise the Lord!" (Psalm 150:6)

"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise." (Psalm 98:4)

## Worship Ideas
1. "Jesus Loves Me Rock" - Add hand motions and jumping during the chorus
2. "This Little Light of Mine" - Use finger motions and turn in circles
3. "God's Love Is Like a Circle" - Form a circle and walk while singing, then make heart shapes with hands

Each song can include simple percussion instruments like tambourines or shakers to enhance engagement and musical development.

### Devotional Thought
God loves to hear children worship Him! Just like parents love hearing their children say "I love you," our Heavenly Father delights in our praise. When we sing worship songs, we're telling God how much we love Him and thank Him for His goodness. Jesus said we should become like little children in our faith, and worship is a perfect way to express that childlike trust and joy.

Dear God, thank you for giving us music to praise you. Help us worship you with all our heart. Amen.
