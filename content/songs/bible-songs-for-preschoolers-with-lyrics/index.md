### Scripture
"Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom, singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, with thankfulness in your hearts to God." - Colossians 3:16

"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise." - Psalm 98:4

### Devotional Thought
Just as Jesus welcomed little children to come to Him, He delights in hearing young voices sing His praises. When we teach our little ones to worship through song, we're helping them express their love for God in their own special way. Every smile, every dance move, and every imperfect note is precious to Him.

Prayer: "Dear Jesus, thank you for giving us songs to praise you. Help us to share your love through music. Amen."

### FAQs
1. What age should children start learning Bible songs?
Children can start learning Bible songs as early as infancy. Even babies benefit from hearing spiritual music, and toddlers naturally begin to engage with simple melodies and movements around age 2-3.

2. How can I make Bible songs more engaging for preschoolers?
Incorporate hand motions, use visual aids like puppets or pictures, and keep sessions short (5-10 minutes). Repetition is key, and don't be afraid to be silly and energetic while leading the songs.

Look for Christian children's music on platforms like YouTube Kids, Christian streaming services, or purchase CDs from trusted Christian artists. Many church curriculum providers also offer downloadable song collections specifically designed for preschoolers.
