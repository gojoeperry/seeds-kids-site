### Devotional Thought
Just as our bodies can move and dance, God's love moves in our hearts. When we sing and move together, we show God how happy we are to be His children. Jesus loves to see His children worship with joy and enthusiasm! Every jump, spin, and gesture can be a way to say "I love You" to God.

Dear God, thank You for giving us bodies to move and voices to sing. Help us worship You with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength. Amen.
