"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise." - Psalm 98:4

## Worship Ideas

2. "Jesus' Love is Bubbling Over" - Children pretend to be bubbling fountains while singing about Jesus' love, starting small and growing bigger with their movements.

3. "This Little Light of Mine" - Kids hold up their "light" (pointer finger) and act out various motions like hiding it under a bushel or letting it shine all around the world.

### Devotional Thought
Just as our bodies move and dance when we're happy, God loves to see us express our joy in worship. Jesus wants us to come to Him like little children, full of enthusiasm and love. When we sing and move in worship, we're using our whole selves to show God how much we love Him.

Dear God, thank you for giving us songs to sing and ways to move as we worship You. Help us to always praise You with joy in our hearts. Amen.
