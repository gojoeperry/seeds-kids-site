# Which Verse Is Good For Children?

# Which Verse is Good for Children? Best Bible Verses for Young Hearts

### Introduction
When wondering "which verse is good for children?" parents and teachers often seek Scripture that speaks directly to young hearts. Finding the right Bible verses for kids is essential for building a strong spiritual foundation during their formative years. The best verses for children are those that communicate God's love in simple, memorable ways while teaching important values they can apply to their daily lives. When considering which verse is good for children, look for passages that use clear language and relatable concepts. These verses become anchors of faith that kids can carry with them as they grow, helping them understand God's character and His special love for them.

### Scripture
"Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these." - Matthew 19:14

"Train up a child in the way he should go; even when he is old he will not depart from it." - Proverbs 22:6

## Worship Ideas
1. Memory Verse Motions: Create hand movements for each key phrase in the verse. For example, with Matthew 19:14, children can make walking motions for "come to me" and spread their arms wide for "kingdom of heaven."

2. Bible Verse Songs: Set simple verses to familiar tunes like "Jesus Loves Me" or "Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star." Add clapping or jumping to make it more engaging.

3. Scripture Art: Have children draw pictures representing their favorite Bible verse, then display them on a "Verse Wall."

### Devotional Thought
God loves children so much that He wants them to know Him personally. Jesus showed this when He welcomed children, blessed them, and used them as examples of pure faith. When we read and memorize Bible verses, we're getting to know God better, just like getting to know a best friend.

Prayer: "Dear Jesus, thank you for loving children so much. Help us learn Your words and keep them in our hearts. Make us more like You every day. Amen."

### FAQs

A: Children can start learning simple Bible verses as early as age 3-4. Start with short, easy-to-understand verses like "God is love" (1 John 4:8) and gradually progress to longer passages as they grow.

Q: How can I make Bible verse memorization fun for kids?
A: Make it interactive with games, songs, and actions. Use reward charts, create art projects, or turn verses into simple plays. The key is to keep it enjoyable and not make it feel like a chore.

Q: Where can I find more resources for teaching Bible verses to children?
A: Look for children's Bible apps, Christian bookstores' children's sections, Sunday School curriculum providers, and online Christian education websites. Many churches also offer free resources for families to use at home.
