Dear God, thank you for giving us songs to praise you. Help us to worship you with joy! Amen.

### FAQs

### What age should children start learning worship songs?
Children can start learning worship songs as early as 18 months old. At this age, they can begin to mimic simple motions and learn basic phrases. The key is choosing songs with repetitive lyrics and engaging movements.

### How can I teach worship songs to active toddlers who won't sit still?
Embrace their energy! Incorporate movement into worship time with actions, dancing, and musical instruments. Keep sessions short (5-10 minutes) and use songs with simple, repeated phrases. Remember that movement is a natural way for toddlers to express worship.

### Where can I find appropriate worship songs for toddlers?
Look for resources from Christian children's music artists like Yancy, Seeds Family Worship, or Hillsong Kids. Many churches also offer children's worship curriculum with age-appropriate songs. YouTube channels dedicated to Christian children's music can be helpful, but always preview content first.
