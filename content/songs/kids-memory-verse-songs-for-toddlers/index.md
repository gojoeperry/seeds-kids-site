### How can I incorporate memory verse songs into our daily routine?
Try singing Bible verse songs during everyday activities like car rides, bath time, or clean-up time. Make it part of your bedtime routine, or start your day with a morning praise time. Consistency and repetition help children learn naturally without pressure.

Look for resources from Christian children's music artists like Seeds Family Worship, Scripture Lullabies, or Yancy. Many churches offer children's worship CDs, and there are numerous Christian YouTube channels dedicated to kids' Bible songs.
