### Scripture
"When you lie down, you will not be afraid; when you lie down, your sleep will be sweet." - Proverbs 3:24

"The Lord your God is with you, the Mighty Warrior who saves. He will take great delight in you; in his love he will no longer rebuke you, but will rejoice over you with singing." - Zephaniah 3:17

## Worship Ideas
1. "Jesus Loves Me" Bedtime Version - Sing slowly and softly, adding gentle back rubs
2. "He's Got the Whole World in His Hands" - Use slow hand motions while rocking
3. Create a simple lullaby melody using your child's name and "Jesus loves (child's name)" as the main phrase

Include soft instruments like wind chimes or a music box to enhance the peaceful atmosphere. Keep movements minimal and gentle as bedtime approaches.

### Devotional Thought
Just as parents love tucking their children into bed, God watches over us with loving care. He never sleeps and always keeps us safe. When we feel scared or lonely at night, we can remember that Jesus is right beside us, singing songs of love over us.

Prayer: "Dear Jesus, thank you for watching over me while I sleep. Help me feel your love and peace. Keep me safe and help me rest in your arms. Amen."
