# Christian Action Songs for Adults: Leading Kids in Dynamic Worship

### Introduction
Christian action songs for adults are powerful tools for leading children into meaningful worship experiences. When grown-ups enthusiastically participate in action-based praise, it creates an inviting atmosphere where kids feel comfortable expressing their love for God through movement and song. These Christian action songs for adults are designed to break down barriers and demonstrate that worship can be both reverent and fun. As leaders, when we engage wholeheartedly in action songs, we model authentic worship and help children understand that praising God involves our whole being - body, mind, and spirit. This multigenerational approach to worship strengthens faith foundations and creates lasting spiritual memories for children.

### Scripture
"Let them praise his name with dancing and make music to him with timbrel and harp." - Psalm 149:3

"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise." - Psalm 98:4

## Worship Ideas
1. "Every Move I Make" - Lead children in simple hand motions that follow the lyrics, incorporating full-body movements during the chorus.

2. "Father Abraham" - This classic action song builds excitement as movements are added progressively, perfect for burning energy while learning about faith heritage.

3. "Lord I Lift Your Name on High" - Teach children sign language motions that illustrate Jesus's story from heaven to earth to the cross and back to heaven.

### Devotional Thought
Just as David danced before the Lord with all his might, God delights in seeing His children worship Him with enthusiasm and joy. When we move and sing together, we're showing God that we love Him with everything we have - not just our words, but our actions too. Remember, worship isn't about perfect movements; it's about a heart that wants to praise God.

Dear God, thank you for giving us bodies to move and voices to sing. Help us worship You with joy and freedom. Amen.

### FAQs

A: Action songs are suitable for all ages, but they're especially engaging for children aged 3-12. Adults can modify movements based on their group's abilities and energy levels.

Q: How can I incorporate action songs if I feel self-conscious?
A: Start with simple hand motions and gradually add more movement as you become comfortable. Remember, your enthusiasm matters more than perfect execution, and children respond to genuine participation.

A: Quality action songs are available through Christian children's ministry websites, YouTube channels like Seeds Family Worship or Go Fish Kids, and church curriculum resources. Many come with instructional videos for learning the movements.
