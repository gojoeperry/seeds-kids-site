# Kids Praise Songs with Actions: Making Worship Fun and Meaningful

### Introduction
Kids praise songs with actions provide an engaging and memorable way for children to connect with God through music and movement. When young hearts and hands join together in worship, they experience God's presence in a uniquely powerful way that resonates with their natural enthusiasm for music and motion. Kids praise songs with actions help children internalize biblical truths while creating joyful memories that can last a lifetime. These interactive worship experiences are especially valuable because they cater to different learning styles – kinesthetic, auditory, and visual – ensuring that every child can participate fully in praising God. For parents and teachers, these songs offer practical tools to nurture spiritual growth while channeling children's boundless energy into meaningful worship expressions.

### Scripture
"Let everything that has breath praise the Lord. Praise the Lord!" (Psalm 150:6)

"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise." (Psalm 98:4)

## Worship Ideas
1. "Every Move I Make" - Children stretch their arms wide during "waves of mercy," make wave motions for "waves of grace," and spin in circles for "everywhere I look."

2. "Jesus' Love is Bubbling Over" - Kids start crouched down and slowly rise while making bubbling motions with their hands, then jump up with arms raised for "bubbling over."

3. "This Little Light of Mine" - Hold up index finger as a candle, hide it under the other hand, point to neighbors, and make blowing motions.

### Devotional Thought
Just as our bodies can dance and move to show happiness, our hearts can jump with joy when we think about God's love. Jesus wants us to worship Him with our whole selves – our voices, our movements, and our hearts. When we praise Him with actions, we're showing that His love makes us so happy we can't keep still!

Prayer: "Dear Jesus, thank you for giving us bodies that can move and voices that can sing. Help us to praise you with joy in our hearts. Amen."

### FAQs
**What age group is best for action songs?**
Action songs work well for children ages 2-12, but they're especially effective for preschool and elementary-aged children (3-10 years old). Adjust movements to be simpler for younger children and more complex for older ones.

**How can I teach new action songs effectively?**
Break down the movements into simple steps, demonstrate them slowly, and practice one section at a time. Use visual aids or pictures when possible, and always model enthusiasm. Remember to explain what the words mean while teaching the motions.

**Where can I find good kids' praise songs with actions?**
You can find action songs through Christian children's ministry websites, YouTube channels like Hillsong Kids or KidzBop Worship, and children's worship curriculum providers. Many churches also offer worship resource packages specifically designed for children's ministry.
