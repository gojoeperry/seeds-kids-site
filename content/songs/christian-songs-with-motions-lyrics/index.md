# Christian Songs With Motions Lyrics

## Christian Songs with Motions Lyrics for Kids

### Introduction
Teaching children Christian songs with motions lyrics is one of the most engaging and effective ways to help them connect with God through worship. When kids combine singing with physical movements, they engage multiple senses, making the learning experience more memorable and meaningful. Christian songs with motions lyrics help children internalize biblical truths while having fun, creating positive associations with worship from an early age. These interactive worship experiences allow kids to express their love for Jesus with their whole bodies, minds, and spirits. Whether you're a parent, Sunday school teacher, or children's ministry leader, incorporating motion songs into your worship time can transform routine lessons into dynamic, joy-filled encounters with God.

### Scripture
"Let them praise his name with dancing and make music to him with timbrel and harp." - Psalm 149:3

"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise." - Psalm 98:4

## Worship Ideas
1. "Every Move I Make" - Have children sway side to side for "waves of mercy," make wave motions for "waves of grace," and spin in circles for "everywhere I look."

2. "This Little Light of Mine" - Hold up pointer fingers as "lights," hide hands behind backs for "hide it under a bushel," and make whooshing motions for "won't let Satan blow it out."

3. "Father Abraham" - This classic action song gets kids moving with right arm, left arm, right foot, left foot, chin up, turn around, and sit down!

### Devotional Thought
Just as God gave us our whole bodies, He wants us to worship Him with everything we have. When we sing and move in worship, we're showing God that we love Him with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength. Jesus welcomes children's praise and delights in our joyful expressions of worship.

Prayer: Dear Jesus, thank you for giving us songs to sing and ways to move as we worship You. Help us to always praise You with joy and freedom. Amen.

### FAQs

### What age group is best for motion songs?
Motion songs work well for children ages 2-12, but they're especially effective for preschool and elementary-aged kids (3-8 years old). Younger children naturally love to move and learn through physical activity, while older kids can grasp deeper meanings behind the motions.

### How can I teach new motion songs effectively?
Start by teaching the motions without music, then add words gradually. Demonstrate the movements clearly, break down complex actions into simple steps, and be enthusiastic! Remember to praise participation and make it fun rather than focusing on perfect execution.

### Where can I find good Christian motion songs?
You can find Christian songs with motions lyrics through resources like:
- "YouTube channels dedicated to kids' worship"
- "Children's ministry websites"
- "Christian streaming platforms"
- "Sunday School curriculum materials"
- "Popular worship leaders' kids' albums"
