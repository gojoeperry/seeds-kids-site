Just as earthly parents tuck their children in at night, our Heavenly Father watches over us always. When we feel scared or alone in the dark, we can remember that God never sleeps and always keeps us safe. Jesus promised to be with us always, even when we close our eyes to sleep.

Prayer: "Dear Jesus, thank you for watching over me as I sleep. Help me feel your love and peace. Amen."
