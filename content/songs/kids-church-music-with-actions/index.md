# Kids Church Music With Actions

# Kids Church Music with Actions: Engaging Children in Joyful Worship

### Introduction
Kids church music with actions offers an incredible way to help children connect with God through engaging, whole-body worship. When children combine music with movement, they're not just singing songs – they're creating lasting memories of praise that can shape their faith journey. Kids church music with actions helps young worshippers understand biblical truths while channeling their natural energy into meaningful expression. This dynamic approach to worship speaks directly to how children learn best: through movement, repetition, and active participation. By incorporating actions into worship music, we create an environment where kids can authentically express their love for God while building a foundation of biblical knowledge that will serve them throughout their lives.

### Scripture
"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise." - Psalm 98:4

"Let everything that has breath praise the Lord. Praise the Lord!" - Psalm 150:6

## Worship Ideas
1. "Jesus' Love is Like a Rainbow" - Have children make rainbow arches with their arms while singing about God's promises
2. "I'm in the Lord's Army" - Include marching in place, saluting, and following simple drill movements
3. "This Little Light of Mine" - Let kids hold up finger "candles" and make shining motions while moving around

Each song can be adapted for different age groups and spaces, making them perfect for both home devotionals and church settings.

### Devotional Thought
Just as our bodies can dance and move in praise, God wants our whole hearts to be filled with joy in worship. When we use actions in our songs, we're showing God that we love Him with everything we have – our voices, our hands, our feet, and our hearts. Jesus loves to see children worship Him with such enthusiasm and freedom.

Prayer: "Dear Jesus, thank you for giving us music and movement to praise you. Help us to worship you with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength. Amen."

### FAQs

**What age group is best for action songs in worship?**
Action songs work well for children ages 2-12, but they're especially effective for preschool and elementary-aged children (3-8 years old). Adjust the complexity of movements based on your group's age and abilities.

**How can I teach new actions to a group of children?**
Start by demonstrating the actions slowly while explaining them. Break down complex movements into simple steps, and practice without music first. Then add the music slowly, gradually increasing to normal speed as children master the movements.

**Where can I find good resources for kids' worship songs with actions?**
Many Christian children's ministries offer online video tutorials and song collections. Popular sources include Hillsong Kids, Yancy Ministries, and Go Fish Resources. Your local Christian bookstore may also carry DVDs and CDs specifically designed for children's worship with actions.
