# Action Songs For Kids With Actions

# Action Songs for Kids with Actions: Making Worship Fun and Meaningful

### Introduction
Action songs for kids with actions are a powerful way to engage children in worship while helping them learn biblical truths through movement and music. When children combine physical movements with spiritual songs, they're more likely to remember the messages and experience joy in worship. These interactive worship experiences create lasting memories and help build a strong foundation of faith. By incorporating action songs for kids with actions into your family or ministry time, you're helping children express their love for God in a way that comes naturally to them. Young ones are full of energy and enthusiasm, and action songs provide the perfect outlet for praising God with their whole being - body, mind, and spirit.

### Scripture
"Let them praise his name with dancing and make music to him with timbrel and harp." - Psalm 149:3

"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise." - Psalm 98:4

## Worship Ideas
1. "Jesus' Love is Bubbling Over" - Children pretend to be a bubbling fountain, starting crouched down and slowly rising with arms extending upward
2. "This Little Light of Mine" - Hold up pointer fingers as "lights," hide them under the other hand, and make circular motions
3. "Father Abraham" - A classic action song where kids follow progressive movements (right arm, left arm, right foot, left foot, etc.) while singing about Abraham's many sons

### Devotional Thought
Just as our bodies move and dance when we're happy, God loves to see us express our joy in worship. Jesus welcomed little children and enjoyed their presence. When we sing and move in worship, we're showing God our love in a special way. We can praise Him with every part of ourselves!

Prayer: "Dear God, thank you for giving us songs to sing and bodies to move in worship. Help us to always praise you with joy in our hearts. Amen."

### FAQs
Q: What age group is best suited for action songs?
A: Action songs are particularly effective for children ages 2-10, but can be adapted for any age. Younger children enjoy simple movements, while older kids can handle more complex actions and longer songs.

Q: How can I teach new action songs effectively?
A: Start by teaching the actions without music, then add words gradually. Demonstrate movements clearly, use repetition, and keep it fun and encouraging. Remember to explain what the songs mean to help children connect with the message.

Q: Where can I find good action songs for kids?
A: Many Christian children's ministry websites offer free resources. Popular sources include Hillsong Kids, Seeds Family Worship, and YouTube channels dedicated to children's worship. Your local Christian bookstore may also have DVDs and CDs with action songs.
