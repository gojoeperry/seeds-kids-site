When children learn to express their love for Jesus through song and movement, they develop a natural, joyful connection with God that can last a lifetime.

3. "God's Love is So Big" with Stretching
Have children stretch their arms wide, high, and low to show how big, tall, and deep God's love is.

God loves to hear children worship! Just like parents love hearing their children sing and laugh, our Heavenly Father delights in the praise of His little ones. When we worship, we're telling God how much we love Him and thank Him for all He's done. Every song we sing is like giving God a big hug!

Dear God, thank you for music and for letting us praise you with songs. Help us to worship you with all our hearts. Amen.
