# Praise Kids Praise Songs: Growing Young Worshippers

### Introduction
Praise kids praise songs are a powerful way to help children connect with God through music and movement. When young hearts learn to worship through engaging praise kids praise songs, they develop a foundation for lifelong faith and a personal relationship with Jesus. These specially designed worship songs combine simple lyrics, memorable melodies, and fun motions that make praise accessible and enjoyable for children. By introducing kids to worship early, we help them understand that praising God can be both meaningful and fun. Parents and teachers play a crucial role in nurturing this spirit of worship, creating an environment where children feel free to express their love for God through song, dance, and joyful noise.

### Scripture
"Let everything that has breath praise the Lord! Praise the Lord!" (Psalm 150:6)
"From the lips of children and infants you, Lord, have called forth your praise." (Matthew 21:16)

## Worship Ideas
1. "Jump for Jesus" - Have children jump when singing Jesus' name and spin in circles during the chorus. This combines worship with physical activity.

2. "God's Love Is Like a Rainbow" - Use colored scarves or ribbons while singing about different aspects of God's love. Each color represents something special about God (red for love, blue for faithfulness, etc.).

3. "Bible Heroes Praise Parade" - March around the room with instruments, acting out different Bible characters who praised God (like David dancing or Paul singing in prison).

### Devotional Thought
God loves to hear our praise, no matter how young we are! Just like parents smile when their children sing to them, our Heavenly Father delights in hearing our worship. Jesus welcomed children and said we should have faith like them. When we praise God, we're telling Him how much we love Him and thank Him for all He's done.

Prayer: "Dear Jesus, thank you for loving us. Help us to praise you with our whole hearts. We love you! Amen."
