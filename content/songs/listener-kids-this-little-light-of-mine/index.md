# Listener Kids This Little Light Of Mine

# Listener Kids This Little Light of Mine: A Guide to Children's Worship

### Introduction
"Listener Kids This Little Light of Mine" has become a beloved children's worship song that teaches vital spiritual truths through its simple, engaging lyrics. This timeless tune helps children understand that they each carry God's light within them and have the special responsibility to share it with the world. When kids sing "Listener Kids This Little Light of Mine," they're not just learning a catchy melody – they're internalizing the important message that even small actions can make a big difference for God's kingdom. The song's repetitive nature and easy-to-follow motions make it perfect for young worshippers, while its profound message resonates with believers of all ages.

### Scripture
"You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden." - Matthew 5:14

"For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Live as children of light." - Ephesians 5:8

## Worship Ideas
1. Light and Share: Give each child a battery-operated tea light and form a circle. As they sing, have them "hide" and "shine" their lights according to the lyrics.

2. Mission Moments: Create simple actions for each verse (pointing up for "shine," cupping hands for "hide," blowing for "won't let Satan blow it out"). Let children take turns leading the motions.

3. Light Chain: After singing, have children write or draw ways they can share God's light on paper strips, then connect them into a classroom chain.

### Devotional Thought
Just like a small flashlight can light up a dark room, our small acts of kindness and love can shine God's light in a dark world. Jesus wants us to be brave and let our lights shine by being kind, telling the truth, and sharing His love with others. We don't need to be grown up or special – God can use even the smallest light to make a big difference.

Dear God, help us be brave and let our lights shine bright for You. Thank you for putting Your light inside us. Amen.
