# Christian Songs for 3 Year Olds: Building Early Faith Through Music

### Introduction
Introducing Christian songs for 3 year olds is one of the most beautiful ways to plant seeds of faith in young hearts. At this precious age, children are like sponges, eagerly absorbing everything around them - including the messages and melodies we share. Simple Christian songs for 3 year olds help establish a foundation of faith through memorable tunes and basic biblical truths. These songs become powerful tools for teaching about God's love, kindness, and the wonderful world He created. Whether you're a parent, Sunday school teacher, or caregiver, incorporating faith-based music into your daily routine can make spiritual learning both fun and meaningful for toddlers. The repetitive nature of children's worship songs helps reinforce positive messages while creating joyful moments of connection with God.

### Scripture
"Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these." - Matthew 19:14

"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth." - Psalm 100:1

## Worship Ideas
1. "Jesus Loves Me" with simple hand motions (crossing arms over heart for "loves," pointing up for "Jesus")
2. "This Little Light of Mine" using finger motions to represent the light
3. "God Made Everything" - a simple song where children point to different body parts or things in nature as you sing about God's creation

Make these songs interactive by adding clapping, jumping, or swaying. Use colorful props like scarves or stuffed animals to enhance engagement.

### Devotional Thought
God gave us music as a special gift to praise Him and learn about His love. Just as birds sing happy songs in the morning, we can sing joyful songs to celebrate God's goodness. When we sing about Jesus, we're telling Him "thank you" for being our friend and loving us so much.

Dear God, thank you for music and for helping us learn about you through songs. Help us to sing with happy hearts. Amen.
