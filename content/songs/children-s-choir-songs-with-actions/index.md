# Children's Choir Songs with Actions: Engaging Kids in Joyful Worship

### Introduction
Teaching children's choir songs with actions creates an engaging and memorable way for kids to worship God with their whole hearts and bodies. When young ones combine singing with movement, they're more likely to remember both the melody and the meaningful lyrics that point them to Jesus. Children's choir songs with actions help develop coordination while building biblical foundations through music. This multi-sensory approach to worship isn't just fun â€“ it helps kids internalize spiritual truths in ways that purely verbal instruction cannot achieve. Whether you're leading worship in Sunday School, children's church, or at home, incorporating actions into choir songs helps channel children's natural energy into praise while creating precious memories of worshipping together.

### Scripture
"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise." - Psalm 98:4

"Let everything that has breath praise the Lord. Praise the Lord!" - Psalm 150:6

## Worship Ideas
1. "Every Move I Make" - Have children stretch arms wide on "waves of mercy," make wave motions for "waves of grace," and spin in circles for "everywhere I look." Perfect for preschool through elementary ages.

2. "This Little Light of Mine" - Hold up index finger as a "light," hide it under the other hand for "hide it under a bushel," and make a blowing motion for "won't let Satan blow it out."

3. "Father Abraham" - This classic action song gets everyone moving with right arm, left arm, right foot, left foot, chin up, turn around, and sit down!

### Devotional Thought
Just as we use our whole bodies to show excitement about things we love, God delights when we worship Him with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength. Jesus welcomes children's praise, and He loves to see us express our joy in creative ways. When we sing and move in worship, we're showing God that we love Him with everything we are.

Prayer: "Dear Jesus, thank you for the gift of music and movement. Help us worship you with joy and freedom. We love you! Amen."

### FAQs

**What age group is best for action songs in children's choir?**
Action songs work well for ages 3-12, but can be adapted for any age. Preschoolers especially benefit from simple motions, while older elementary students enjoy more complex choreography and sign language elements.

**How can I teach new actions to a large group of children?**
Break down the motions into small, manageable parts. First demonstrate while kids watch, then have them mirror your actions without music, and finally add the song slowly. Practice one section at a time before putting it all together.

**Where can I find good children's choir songs with actions?**
Many Christian publishers offer children's worship curricula with action songs. Websites like YouTube have demonstration videos, and resources from publishers like LifeWay and Group Publishing provide sheet music and motion guides. Your local Christian bookstore may also have DVDs and songbooks specifically for children's choir.
