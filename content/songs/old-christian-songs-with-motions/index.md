# Old Christian Songs With Motions

# Old Christian Songs with Motions for Kids' Worship

### Introduction
Old Christian songs with motions have been a cornerstone of children's ministry for generations, helping young hearts connect with Jesus through music and movement. These timeless songs combine simple melodies with hand gestures and body movements, making worship both fun and memorable for kids. When children engage in old Christian songs with motions, they're not just singing – they're using their whole bodies to express praise, which helps embed biblical truths deep in their hearts and minds. These songs create lasting memories and spiritual foundations that children carry with them throughout their lives. For parents and teachers, these interactive worship songs provide an excellent way to channel children's natural energy while teaching them about God's love in an age-appropriate way.

### Scripture
"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise." - Psalm 98:4

"Let them praise his name with dancing and make music to him with timbrel and harp." - Psalm 149:3

## Worship Ideas
1. "This Little Light of Mine" - Have children hold up one finger as their "light" and follow motions for "hide it under a bushel - NO!" and "let it shine."

2. "Jesus Loves Me" - Incorporate heart shapes with hands, pointing to self, and arms crossed over chest.

3. "Deep and Wide" - Use traditional arm movements showing depth and width, getting faster and dropping words while keeping motions.

### Devotional Thought
Just as we use our whole bodies to worship God through these songs, Jesus wants all of us – our hearts, minds, and actions – to show His love to others. When we sing and move in worship, we're reminding ourselves that God's love isn't just something we think about – it's something we live out every day.

Dear Jesus, thank you for giving us songs to help us remember your love. Help us worship you with our whole hearts and bodies. Amen.
