# Christian Songs With Motions For Children

# Christian Songs with Motions for Children: Making Worship Fun and Meaningful

### Introduction
Teaching christian songs with motions for children is one of the most effective ways to help young hearts connect with God through worship. When kids combine music with movement, they engage multiple senses, making the experience more memorable and meaningful. Christian songs with motions for children not only make worship fun but also help them internalize biblical truths in a natural, age-appropriate way. These songs become powerful tools for spiritual formation, allowing children to express their love for God while building a foundation of faith that can last a lifetime. As parents and teachers, we have the wonderful opportunity to guide our little ones in joyful worship that gets their whole bodies involved in praising Jesus.

### Scripture
"Let everything that has breath praise the Lord!" (Psalm 150:6)

"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise." (Psalm 98:4)

## Worship Ideas
1. "Jesus Loves Me" with Sign Language
- "Teach simple sign language motions for key words like "love," "Jesus," and "Bible"
- "Add gentle swaying movements during the chorus"

2. "This Little Light of Mine"
- "Hold up pointer fingers as "lights"
- "Make circular motions for "all around the neighborhood"
- "Use hiding motions for "hide it under a bushel"

3. "Father Abraham"
- "Include full-body movements (right arm, left arm, right foot, left foot)"
- "Add jumping and spinning for extra engagement"

### Devotional Thought
Just as our bodies can dance and move in worship, God wants our whole hearts to be filled with joy when we praise Him. Jesus loves to see children worship with enthusiasm and sincerity. When we sing and move in worship, we're showing God that we love Him with everything we have.

Prayer: "Dear Jesus, thank you for giving us songs to sing and ways to move as we worship you. Help us to always praise you with joy in our hearts. Amen."

### FAQs

**What age group is best suited for worship songs with motions?**
Motion songs work well for children ages 2-12, but they're especially effective for preschool and early elementary ages (3-8 years old). Adapt the complexity of motions based on your group's age and abilities.

**How can I teach new motions effectively to children?**
Break down the motions into simple steps, demonstrate them slowly, and practice one section at a time. Use repetition and make it fun by turning it into a game. Remember to be patient and encouraging as children learn.

**Where can I find good resources for Christian motion songs?**
Look for children's worship videos on YouTube channels like Seeds Family Worship or Hillsong Kids. Christian bookstores often carry DVDs with motion songs, and many children's ministry websites offer free resources and tutorials for teaching worship motions to kids.
