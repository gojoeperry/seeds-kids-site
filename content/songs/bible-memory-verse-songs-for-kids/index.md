### Scripture
"I have hidden your word in my heart that I might not sin against you." - Psalm 119:11

"Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom, singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs." - Colossians 3:16

## Worship Ideas
1. "The B-I-B-L-E" with jumping motions for each letter
2. Create hand motions for key words in memory verses (e.g., pointing up for "God," crossing arms over heart for "love")
3. "Books of the Bible" song with a simple dance routine for Old and New Testament sections

Make these activities interactive by having children take turns leading motions or forming small groups to practice different parts of songs together.
