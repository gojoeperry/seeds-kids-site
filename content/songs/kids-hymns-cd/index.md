# Kids Hymns Cd

# Teaching Kids Classic Hymns Through Music

### Introduction
Introducing children to hymns through a kids hymns CD is one of the most powerful ways to plant seeds of faith that will bloom throughout their lives. These timeless songs contain deep spiritual truths wrapped in memorable melodies that can shape a child's understanding of God from an early age. When young ones learn hymns through age-appropriate kids hymns CDs, they're not just memorizing songs â€“ they're absorbing foundational teachings about God's character, His love, and our response to Him. The combination of music and truth creates lasting impressions that can guide children through their spiritual journey. Parents and teachers have found that using a quality kids hymns CD during family devotions, car rides, or bedtime routines helps make sacred music a natural part of daily life.

### Scripture
"Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom, singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, with thankfulness in your hearts to God." - Colossians 3:16

"Make a joyful noise to the Lord, all the earth! Serve the Lord with gladness! Come into his presence with singing!" - Psalm 100:1-2

## Worship Ideas
1. "Jesus Loves Me" Motions: Have children cross their arms over their chest during "Jesus loves me" and point up for "this I know." Create simple hand motions for each phrase.

2. Hymn Memory Game: Write different hymn titles on cards. Children take turns matching titles with first lines or choruses.

3. "Amazing Grace" Echo: Leader sings one line, children repeat it back. Add simple instruments like tambourines or rhythm sticks.

### Devotional Thought
Just as a beautiful garden grows from tiny seeds, our love for God grows when we plant His truths in our hearts through music. When we sing hymns, we're telling God how much we love Him and reminding ourselves of His amazing love for us. Even Jesus sang hymns with His disciples!

Dear God, thank you for giving us music to praise You. Help us learn these special songs and keep them in our hearts. Amen.
