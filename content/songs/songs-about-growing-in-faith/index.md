# Songs About Growing In Faith

# Songs About Growing in Faith for Kids

### Introduction
Songs about growing in faith provide a powerful way for children to develop their relationship with God through music and movement. When kids learn spiritual truths through engaging melodies and memorable lyrics, these lessons take root in their hearts and minds in unique ways. Songs about growing in faith help children understand abstract concepts like trust, prayer, and God's love through age-appropriate language and fun musical experiences.

As parents and teachers, we can use worship music to create meaningful moments of spiritual connection with our children. Whether at home, in Sunday School, or during family devotion time, these songs become building blocks for a strong spiritual foundation. By incorporating songs about growing in faith into regular routines, we help kids develop habits of worship that can last a lifetime.

### Scripture
"But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ." - 2 Peter 3:18

"Jesus said, 'Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.'" - Matthew 19:14

## Worship Ideas
1. "Faith is Like a Little Seed" - Have children pretend to plant seeds, then slowly grow from a crouched position to standing tall with arms raised, demonstrating how faith grows.

2. "Trust and Obey" with Actions - Create simple hand motions for key words (trust = hands over heart, obey = marching feet). Let kids suggest their own movements.

3. "Growing, Growing" Echo Song - Leader sings a line about growing in faith, children echo back while doing stretching movements.

### Devotional Thought
Just like plants need water and sunlight to grow, our faith needs special care to become strong. God gives us everything we need to grow closer to Him - His Word, prayer, worship, and people who love Jesus. When we spend time with God every day, our faith grows bigger and stronger.

Dear God, help us grow in our faith each day. Thank you for loving us and helping us learn more about you. Amen.
