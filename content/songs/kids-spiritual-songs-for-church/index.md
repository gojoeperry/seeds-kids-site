Jesus loves to hear children's voices lifted in praise - remember how He welcomed the little children to come to Him? Every time we sing, we're sharing our hearts with God and growing closer to Him.

Dear God, thank you for giving us music and songs to praise You. Help us use our voices to share Your love with others. Amen.
