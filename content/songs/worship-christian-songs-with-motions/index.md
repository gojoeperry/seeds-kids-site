# Worship Christian Songs With Motions

# Teaching Kids Worship Christian Songs with Motions

### Introduction
Worship christian songs with motions are a powerful way to help children connect with God through music and movement. When kids engage their whole bodies in worship, they create lasting memories and develop a deeper understanding of biblical truths. These worship christian songs with motions combine fun choreography with meaningful lyrics, making it easier for young hearts to remember and internalize God's Word. By incorporating movement into worship, children can express their joy and praise naturally while building a foundation for lifelong faith. Whether at home, Sunday school, or children's church, action songs help kids stay focused and excited about worshiping Jesus.

### Scripture
"Let them praise his name with dancing and make music to him with timbrel and harp." - Psalm 149:3

"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise." - Psalm 98:4

## Worship Ideas
1. "Every Move I Make" - Children follow simple hand motions showing God's presence all around them while singing about His faithfulness.

2. "Jesus Loves Me Rock" - A high-energy version of the classic song where kids jump, clap, and spin while celebrating God's love.

3. "Deep and Wide" - This traditional action song helps kids learn about God's love using cross motions and expanding arm movements.

### Devotional Thought
Just as we use our whole bodies to show excitement when we're happy, God loves when we use our entire selves to worship Him. Jesus wants us to come to Him like little children - full of joy and ready to dance! When we worship with motions, we're telling God "I love You" with every part of ourselves.

Prayer: "Dear Jesus, thank You for making worship fun and exciting. Help me use my whole body to show You how much I love You. Amen."

### FAQs

**What age group is best for worship songs with motions?**
Action songs work well for children ages 2-12, but they're especially effective for preschool and elementary-aged kids (3-10 years old). Younger children naturally respond to music with movement, while older kids can grasp deeper meaning in the lyrics.

**How can I teach new motions to a group of children?**
Break down the movements into simple steps, demonstrate them slowly, and practice without music first. Then add the music gradually, encouraging children to follow along. Remember to keep motions age-appropriate and celebrate their participation.

**Where can I find good worship songs with motions?**
Many children's ministry resources provide action songs, including Hillsong Kids, GoFish, and Yancy Ministries. YouTube channels dedicated to children's worship often include motion tutorials. Your local Christian bookstore may also carry DVDs and resources specifically designed for kids' worship.
