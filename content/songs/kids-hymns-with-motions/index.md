# Teaching Kids Hymns with Motions: A Joyful Way to Worship

### Introduction
Teaching kids hymns with motions combines the timeless truths of Christian music with engaging physical movement, creating a powerful way for children to connect with God. When young ones learn kids hymns with motions, they're not just memorizing words â€“ they're experiencing worship with their whole bodies and minds. This multi-sensory approach helps children retain biblical truths while making worship fun and meaningful. Adding motions to hymns also helps fidgety kids stay focused and gives them a physical outlet for expressing their love for God. Whether you're a parent, Sunday school teacher, or children's ministry leader, incorporating kids hymns with motions into your teaching toolkit can transform ordinary worship times into dynamic, memorable experiences that shape young hearts for Jesus.

### Scripture
"Let everything that has breath praise the Lord! Praise the Lord!" (Psalm 150:6)

"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise." (Psalm 98:4)

## Worship Ideas
1. "Jesus Loves Me" with Heart Motions
- "Make heart shapes with hands during "Jesus loves me"
- "Point up for "for the Bible tells me so"
- "Rock arms like holding a baby for "little ones to Him belong"

2. "This Little Light of Mine"
- "Hold up pointer finger as "light"
- "Make hiding motion under other hand for "hide it under a bushel"
- "Move finger in circular motion for "let it shine"

3. "He's Got the Whole World in His Hands"
- "Make large circular motions for "whole world"
- "Rock baby motion for "little bitty babies"
- "Spreading arms wide for "you and me brother"

### Devotional Thought
Just as our bodies can move and dance, our hearts can jump with joy for Jesus! When we sing and move together, we're showing God how much we love Him with everything we have. Jesus wants us to come to Him like little children, full of joy and enthusiasm. Every motion we make can be a way to say "I love you" to God.

Dear Jesus, thank you for giving us voices to sing and bodies to move in worship to you. Help us to praise you with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength. Amen.
