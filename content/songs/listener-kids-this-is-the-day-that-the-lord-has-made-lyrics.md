# This Is The Day That The Lord Has Made: Teaching Children to Celebrate God's Daily Gifts

Picture this: Your five-year-old bounces out of bed on a rainy Monday morning, looks out the window, and declares with genuine excitement, "This is the day that the Lord has made! I will rejoice and be glad in it!" Instead of complaining about the weather or dreading the day ahead, your child has learned to see each new day as a precious gift from God worthy of celebration.

This transformation happens when children truly understand the profound truth found in Psalm 118:24: "This is the day that the Lord has made; let us rejoice and be glad in it." Teaching kids to embrace this biblical perspective through Scripture songs creates a foundation of gratitude, joy, and God-centered living that will serve them throughout their lives.

## Biblical Foundation: Every Day is God's Masterpiece

The original Hebrew text of Psalm 118:24 carries deep meaning that children can grasp through music and repetition. The word "made" (asah) implies intentional creation—God didn't accidentally create today; He crafted it specifically for His purposes and our blessing. When we teach children that "this is the day that the Lord has made," we're helping them understand that every sunrise brings new mercies, fresh opportunities, and divine appointments.

Colossians 3:16 encourages us to "let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom, singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, with thankfulness in your hearts to God." Scripture songs about celebrating each day help God's Word take root in young hearts, transforming their perspective from the inside out.

## Why Daily Gratitude Songs Matter for Children's Faith Development

### Cognitive Development Through Repetition

Children's brains are wired to learn through repetition and pattern recognition. When kids sing "This is the day that the Lord has made" repeatedly, they're not just memorizing words—they're programming their neural pathways to automatically respond to new days with gratitude rather than anxiety or complaint.

Research in child development shows that children who practice daily gratitude demonstrate increased resilience, better emotional regulation, and stronger social connections. Scripture songs about celebrating each day provide the perfect vehicle for developing these crucial life skills within a biblical framework.

### Emotional Regulation Through Biblical Truth

Many children struggle with morning anxiety, disappointment when plans change, or fear about upcoming events. Teaching them to declare biblical truth over their circumstances through song provides a powerful coping mechanism rooted in God's Word rather than positive thinking alone.

## Practical Applications for Family Worship

### Morning Routines That Transform

Transform your family's morning routine by incorporating "This is the day" songs as a daily declaration. Start each day by singing together before breakfast, helping children practice choosing gratitude over grumbling. This simple practice sets a tone of worship and expectation for God's goodness throughout the day.

Create a "New Day Celebration" ritual where family members share one thing they're excited about for the day ahead, followed by singing Scripture songs about God's daily faithfulness. This combination of sharing and singing builds anticipation and reinforces the truth that each day holds divine possibilities.

### Handling Difficult Days

When children face challenging circumstances—illness, disappointment, or family stress—"This is the day" songs provide anchor points of truth. Teach kids that declaring God's goodness doesn't mean pretending problems don't exist; it means choosing to trust God's sovereignty even in difficult situations.

Practice singing these songs during minor disappointments (canceled plans, rainy days, small setbacks) so children develop the habit of responding to challenges with faith-filled declarations rather than complaints.

### Seasonal Celebrations

Different seasons offer unique opportunities to explore how "this is the day that the Lord has made" applies year-round. Spring days celebrate new life and growth, summer days highlight God's provision and abundance, autumn days teach gratitude for harvest and change, and winter days emphasize God's faithfulness during quiet seasons.

## Age-Appropriate Implementation Strategies

### Toddlers (Ages 2-4)

For youngest children, focus on simple, repetitive melodies with hand motions. Toddlers learn best through movement and sensory engagement. Create simple actions like raising hands to the sky for "this is the day" and pointing upward for "the Lord has made."

Keep sessions short (2-3 minutes) but consistent. Toddlers thrive on routine, so singing the same "This is the day" song at the same time each morning helps establish positive patterns early.

### Elementary Age (Ages 5-10)

Elementary children can handle more complex lyrics and deeper biblical connections. Help them understand the context of Psalm 118 and discuss how the psalmist chose praise during difficult circumstances. Elementary kids love stories, so share examples of biblical characters who praised God during challenging times.

Encourage children to create their own verses about specific things they're grateful for: "This is the day that the Lord has made, He gave me family and friends to love, I will rejoice and be glad in it!"

### Preteens (Ages 11-13)

Preteens often struggle with mood regulation and peer pressure. "This is the day" songs provide tools for emotional self-regulation rooted in biblical truth rather than cultural messaging. Help preteens understand how choosing gratitude positions them as counter-cultural witnesses to God's goodness.

Discuss practical applications for school settings—how

## Ministry and Church Applications

### Sunday School Integration

Use "This is the day" songs as opening worship for Sunday school classes, helping children transition from weekend activities to focused worship and learning. The familiar refrain helps create consistency across different age groups and teaching topics.

### Family Service Participation

These songs work beautifully for family-friendly worship services, giving children familiar words to sing while adults appreciate the deep biblical truth. Consider featuring these songs on family worship Sundays or during children's sermon times.

### Vacation Bible School Themes

"This is the day that the Lord has made" provides excellent VBS theme material, with each day's activities celebrating different aspects of God's daily gifts—creation, family, salvation, service, and worship.

## Troubleshooting Common Challenges

### When Children Resist Morning Singing

If children initially resist morning worship songs, start with their favorite upbeat tunes and gradually introduce Scripture songs. Make it fun rather than forced—use instruments, dance, or special breakfast treats to create positive associations.

### Addressing Teenage Eye-Rolling

Preteens and teens may initially resist "childish" songs. Acknowledge their growing maturity while explaining the lifelong value of Scripture memorization through music. Share examples of how these biblical truths apply to their specific challenges and concerns.

### Maintaining Consistency During Busy Seasons

During hectic periods, adapt rather than abandon the practice. Even humming the melody while rushing out the door maintains the connection between new days and gratitude.

## Advanced Implementation Ideas

### Create Family Worship Journals

Combine singing with writing by having children record daily observations about God's goodness after singing "This is the day" songs. This practice reinforces the biblical truth while developing writing skills and spiritual reflection.

### Develop Personal Theme Songs

Help older children choose specific "This is the day" variations for different situations—school days, weekends, holidays, or challenging times. This personalization increases ownership and application.

### Community Connection

Share your family's "This is the day" practices with other families, creating community around celebrating God's daily gifts. Children love knowing their friends are singing the same songs and learning the same biblical truths.

## Scripture Integration for Deeper Learning

Connect Psalm 118:24 with related verses like Lamentations 3:22-23 ("His mercies are new every morning") and James 1:17 ("Every good gift comes from above"). This broader biblical foundation helps children understand that celebrating each day connects to God's character of faithfulness and generosity.

Study the context of Psalm 118 together, helping children understand that the psalmist chose praise despite facing enemies and difficulties. This historical context gives deeper meaning to declaring "This is the day that the Lord has made" during their own challenging situations.
