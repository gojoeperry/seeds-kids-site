# Kids Worship Music With Actions

# Kids Worship Music with Actions: Engaging Children in Joyful Praise

### Introduction
Kids worship music with actions provides an incredible way for children to connect with God using their whole bodies, minds, and spirits. When young ones combine simple movements with worship songs, they engage multiple senses and create lasting memories of praise. Kids worship music with actions helps children express their love for God naturally and enthusiastically, making worship time both meaningful and fun. Research shows that children retain information better when physical movement is involved, making action songs an effective tool for teaching biblical truths. As parents and teachers, introducing dynamic worship experiences early helps build a strong foundation for lifelong faith and creates positive associations with church and prayer time. Through these interactive worship experiences, children discover that praising God can be a joyful, active celebration.

### Scripture
"Let them praise his name with dancing and make music to him with timbrel and harp." - Psalm 149:3

"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise." - Psalm 98:4

## Worship Ideas
1. "Every Move I Make" - Children jump in place for "move," wave arms for "breath," and spin for "living in you." This classic action song teaches God's constant presence.

2. "Jesus' Love is Bubbling Over" - Kids start crouched down and slowly rise while making bubbling motions with their hands, then burst up with arms raised for "bubbling over."

3. "This Little Light of Mine" - Hold up index finger as a "light," hide it under the other hand for "hide it under a bushel," and make wind-blowing motions for "won't let Satan blow it out."

### Devotional Thought
Just as our bodies can dance, jump, and move, our hearts can also move with love for Jesus. When we worship with actions, we're showing God that we love Him with everything we have - our voices, our movements, and our hearts. Jesus loves seeing children worship Him with such joy and freedom!

Prayer: "Dear Jesus, thank you for giving us bodies that can move and dance in worship to you. Help us remember that every movement can be a way to show our love for you. Amen."
