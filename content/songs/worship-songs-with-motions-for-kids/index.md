# Worship Songs With Motions For Kids

# Worship Songs with Motions for Kids
### Introduction
Teaching worship songs with motions for kids is an incredible way to help young hearts connect with God through music and movement. When children combine singing with actions, they engage multiple senses, making the worship experience more meaningful and memorable. Worship songs with motions for kids allow them to express their love for God with their whole being - heart, mind, and body. This active participation helps them understand that worship isn't just about singing; it's about giving our entire selves to God in praise. As parents and teachers, introducing these interactive worship experiences early helps build a foundation for lifelong worship and faith development.

### Scripture
"Let them praise his name with dancing and make music to him with timbrel and harp." - Psalm 149:3

"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise." - Psalm 98:4

## Worship Ideas
1. "Every Move I Make" - Have kids sway side to side for "waves of mercy," make wave motions for "waves of grace," and spin in circles for "everywhere I look." This song teaches about God's constant presence.

2. "Deep and Wide" - Use expanding arm movements to show "deep" and "wide," creating a cross shape. Add fun variations by whispering, humming, or using different speeds.

3. "This Little Light of Mine" - Hold up index fingers as "lights," hide them behind backs for "hide it under a bushel," and make blowing motions for "won't let Satan blow it out."

### Devotional Thought
Just as we use our whole bodies to show excitement about things we love - like jumping up and down when we're happy - we can use our whole selves to show God how much we love Him. When we worship with motions, we're telling God, "I love You so much that even my hands and feet want to praise You!" Remember, God loves seeing His children worship Him with joy and enthusiasm.

Dear God, thank You for giving us music and movement to praise You. Help us worship You with all our heart, mind, and strength. Amen.

### FAQs

### What age group is best for worship songs with motions?
Worship songs with motions are most effective for children ages 2-10, but can be adapted for any age. Younger children (2-5) especially benefit from simple, repetitive motions, while older kids (6-10) can handle more complex movements and lyrics.

### How can I teach new motions to a group of kids?
Start by teaching the motions without music, breaking them down into simple steps. Demonstrate slowly, then practice together. Once kids are comfortable with the movements, add the music gradually. Remember to keep it fun and don't worry about perfection.

### Where can I find good worship songs with motions?
You can find age-appropriate worship songs with motions through Christian children's ministry resources like Yancy Ministries, Seeds Family Worship, or KidSpring. Many churches also offer children's worship curriculum with motion songs, and numerous videos are available on YouTube Kids and RightNow Media.
