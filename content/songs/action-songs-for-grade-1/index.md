# Action Songs For Grade 1

# Action Songs for Grade 1: Getting Kids Moving for Jesus

### Introduction
Action songs for Grade 1 students provide an exciting and engaging way to help young children connect with God through music and movement. At this developmental stage, kids learn best when they can participate with their whole bodies, making action songs the perfect tool for worship and biblical learning. These dynamic worship experiences help form lasting spiritual foundations while creating joy-filled memories of praising God.

When Grade 1 students participate in action songs, they're not just having fun â€“ they're developing coordination, memory skills, and most importantly, a heart for worship. Action songs for Grade 1 classes help reinforce biblical truths through repetition and movement, making lessons more memorable and meaningful. Parents and teachers can use these active worship experiences to channel children's natural energy into praising God.

### Scripture
"Let them praise his name with dancing and make music to him with timbrel and harp." - Psalm 149:3

"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise." - Psalm 98:4

## Worship Ideas
1. "Jesus' Love is Bubbling Over" - Children make bubbling motions with their hands while rising from crouching to standing, showing how God's love grows inside them.

2. "I'm in the Lord's Army" - Kids march in place, salute, and follow other military-inspired actions while learning about being strong in God.

3. "This Little Light of Mine" - Students hold up pointing fingers as "candles" and perform various motions to show how they let their light shine for Jesus.

### Devotional Thought
Just as our bodies move and dance when we're happy, God loves to see us express our joy in worship. Jesus wants us to come to Him like little children, full of energy and excitement. When we sing and move in worship, we're showing God how much we love Him with our whole selves.

Dear God, thank you for giving us bodies that can move and dance. Help us use our movements to praise you and show others your love. Amen.
