## Worship Ideas

Teach children to sign basic words while singing this classic, creating a multi-sensory worship experience.

2. "This Little Light of Mine" with Actions

3. "Father Abraham" with Movement
This energetic song gets kids moving their arms, legs, and whole body while learning about faith and following God.

### Devotional Thought
Just as birds sing their beautiful songs to express joy, God gave us voices to sing His praises. When we worship through song, we're telling God how much we love Him and thanking Him for His goodness. Jesus loves to hear children's voices lifted in praise!

Prayer: "Dear Jesus, thank you for giving us music and songs to praise you. Help us use our voices to show our love for you. Amen."
