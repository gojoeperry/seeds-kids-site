# Listener Kids: This Is The Day That The Lord Has Made Lyrics

## Listener Kids: This is the day that the Lord has made lyrics
### Introduction
"Listener Kids: This is the day that the Lord has made lyrics" is a joyful celebration of God's daily gifts to us, perfectly crafted for young worship experiences. This beloved children's worship song helps little ones understand that each day is a special present from God, worthy of our praise and thanksgiving. When children learn "Listener Kids: This is the day that the Lord has made lyrics," they develop a foundation of gratitude and learn to recognize God's handiwork in their daily lives. The simple, repetitive nature of the song makes it perfect for toddlers through elementary-aged children, helping them internalize the truth that God is the creator of every new day and every good gift.

### Scripture

"Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights." - James 1:17

## Worship Ideas
1. Morning Circle Time: Start each day by forming a circle and having children take turns jumping into the middle while singing the song, expressing their joy for the new day.

2. Creation Motions: Add simple hand motions - point up for "Lord," spread arms wide for "made," and spin around with joy for "rejoice."

3. Thank You Chain: While singing, have children take turns sharing one thing they're thankful for today, creating a verbal chain of gratitude.

### Devotional Thought
God gives us each new day as a fresh start and a new adventure. Just like opening a present, we can wake up excited to see what special moments God has planned for us. When we sing "This is the day," we're telling God, "Thank you for this amazing gift!" Even if we face challenges, we can remember that God made this day and is with us through every moment.

Dear God, thank you for giving us this beautiful day. Help us to see your love in everything around us. Amen.
