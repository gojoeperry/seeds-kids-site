When young ones learn praise songs with easy-to-understand English lyrics, they can actively participate in worship while building their faith foundation.

### Scripture
"Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these." - Matthew 19:14

"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise." - Psalm 98:4

## Worship Ideas
1. "Jesus Loves Me" with sign language - Teach simple hand motions for key words like "love," "Jesus," and "Bible."

2. "This Little Light of Mine" with finger actions - Use finger movements to represent the light shining and actions for "hide it under a bushel - NO!"

3. Create a praise parade - March around the room with instruments while singing "I'm in the Lord's Army" or "Deep and Wide."

### Devotional Thought
God loves to hear children's voices lifted in praise! Just like parents treasure hearing their children say "I love you," our Heavenly Father delights in hearing His children express their love through song. When we praise God, we're telling Him how amazing He is and thanking Him for His love.

Dear God, thank you for giving us voices to sing and hearts to love you. Help us to praise you with joy every day. Amen.
