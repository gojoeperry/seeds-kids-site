# Praise Christian Songs With Motions

# Teaching Kids Praise Christian Songs with Motions

### Introduction
Praise Christian songs with motions are a powerful way to help children connect with God through music and movement. When kids engage their whole bodies in worship, they experience God's presence in a uniquely meaningful way. Teaching praise Christian songs with motions allows children to express their faith naturally while building lasting spiritual foundations through memorable experiences.

These interactive worship songs help kids understand biblical truths as they combine meaningful lyrics with physical movements. The combination of music, motion, and Scripture creates multi-sensory learning experiences that stick with children long after the song ends. Whether at home, Sunday school, or children's church, incorporating praise songs with motions helps develop confident young worshippers who love expressing their faith.

### Scripture
"Let them praise his name with dancing and make music to him with timbrel and harp." - Psalm 149:3

"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise." - Psalm 98:4

## Worship Ideas
1. "Every Move I Make" - Children follow simple hand motions showing God's presence above, below, and all around while singing about His constant care.

2. "This Little Light of Mine" - Kids hold up pointer fingers like candles, moving them in different directions while learning about sharing God's love.

3. "Jesus Loves Me" - Incorporate heart shapes with hands, pointing to self, and reaching arms wide to reinforce the message of God's endless love.

### Devotional Thought
Just as we use our whole bodies to show excitement about things we love, God delights in seeing His children express joy through movement and song. When we worship with our voices and actions, we're showing God how much we love Him. He created us to praise Him with everything we have!

Prayer: Dear God, thank you for giving us songs to sing and ways to move as we worship You. Help us remember that You love seeing us express our joy in creative ways. Amen.
