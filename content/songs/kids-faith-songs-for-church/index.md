### Devotional Thought
Just as birds sing their beautiful songs to celebrate each morning, God gave us voices to sing His praises. When we sing about Jesus, we're telling Him how much we love Him and thanking Him for His love for us. Every time we lift our voices in worship, it makes God smile!

Prayer: "Dear Jesus, thank you for giving us songs to sing about your love. Help us to worship you with happy hearts. Amen."
