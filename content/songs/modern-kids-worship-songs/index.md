# Modern Kids Worship Songs: Engaging Children in Praise

### Introduction
Modern kids worship songs provide an incredible way to help children connect with God through music that speaks their language. Unlike traditional hymns, these contemporary worship songs feature catchy melodies, simple lyrics, and engaging rhythms that resonate with today's young hearts. When children experience worship through modern songs designed specifically for them, they develop a natural enthusiasm for praising God that can last a lifetime. Modern kids worship songs also help reinforce biblical truths through memorable tunes and movements, making spiritual concepts more accessible and enjoyable. As parents and teachers, introducing these songs creates opportunities for children to express their faith joyfully while building a strong spiritual foundation.

### Scripture
"Let everything that has breath praise the Lord. Praise the Lord!" (Psalm 150:6)

"Make a joyful noise to the Lord, all the earth! Serve the Lord with gladness! Come into his presence with singing!" (Psalm 100:1-2)

## Worship Ideas
1. "Every Move I Make" - Have children jump, spin, and dance while singing about following Jesus. Add hand motions that point up for "heaven" and spread arms wide for "love."

2. "This Little Light of Mine" (modern version) - Give each child a battery-operated tea light to hold while singing. Create movements like making a lighthouse with their lights or hiding them under their hands for "hide it under a bushel."

3. "God's Love Is So Big" - Use expanding arm movements to show God's growing love, reaching high and wide while singing about His endless love.

### Devotional Thought
Just as we feel happy when we sing our favorite songs, God delights in hearing our worship. When we praise Him with modern kids worship songs, we're showing God how much we love Him in a way that's natural and fun. Jesus said to let the little children come to Him, and worship through music is one beautiful way to do that.

Dear God, thank you for giving us music to praise you. Help us remember that you love hearing our songs and seeing our dance moves when we worship you. Amen.
