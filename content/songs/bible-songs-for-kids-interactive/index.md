### Introduction

When we sing and move to worship songs, we're showing God how much we love Him, just like jumping up and down when we're excited about something wonderful.

Prayer: "Dear Jesus, thank you for giving us music and movement to praise you. Help us worship you with joy and teach others about your love through our songs. Amen."
