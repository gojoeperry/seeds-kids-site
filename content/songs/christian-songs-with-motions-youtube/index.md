# Christian Songs With Motions Youtube

# Teaching Kids to Worship with Motion and Song

### Introduction
Christian songs with motions on YouTube have become an incredible tool for helping children engage with worship in meaningful and memorable ways. These interactive worship experiences combine fun movements with biblical truth, making it easier for kids to connect with God through music and motion. When children watch and participate in Christian songs with motions on YouTube, they're not just being entertained – they're developing a foundation for lifelong worship. The combination of music, movement, and Scripture helps kids retain biblical concepts while expressing their love for God in an age-appropriate way. Whether used in Sunday School, children's church, or at home, these engaging worship resources help create an atmosphere where kids can authentically experience God's presence.

### Scripture
"Let them praise his name with dancing and make music to him with timbrel and harp." - Psalm 149:3

"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise." - Psalm 98:4

## Worship Ideas
1. "Every Move I Make" - Have children jump during "na na na" parts, wave arms for "waves of mercy," and spin for "everywhere I go"

2. "This Little Light of Mine" - Use finger motions for the "light," hide hands behind back for "hide it under a bushel," and make wind-blowing motions for "won't let Satan blow it out"

3. "Jesus Loves Me" - Cross arms over chest for "loves," point up for "Jesus," and point to self for "me"

### Devotional Thought
Just as our bodies can move and dance, our hearts can also move with love for Jesus. When we worship with our whole selves – our voices, our bodies, and our hearts – we show God how much we love Him. Jesus wants us to come to Him like little children, full of joy and ready to express our love freely.

Prayer: "Dear Jesus, thank you for giving us music and movement to praise you. Help us worship you with all our heart, mind, and strength. Amen."

### FAQs

### What age group is best for Christian songs with motions?
Christian songs with motions are typically most engaging for children ages 2-10, but can be adapted for any age. Younger children (2-5) especially benefit from simple, repetitive motions, while older kids (6-10) can handle more complex movements and deeper lyrics.

### How can I incorporate motion songs into our family devotion time?
Start by choosing one or two familiar songs and learning the motions together. Make it a regular part of your routine, perhaps before bedtime or during morning devotions. Don't worry about perfect movements – focus on creating a joyful, worship-filled atmosphere.

### Where can I find quality Christian motion songs online?
Many Christian children's ministries maintain YouTube channels with motion songs, including Hillsong Kids, Seeds Family Worship, and Go Fish Kids. Look for channels that combine biblical accuracy with engaging presentations and clear, easy-to-follow motions.
