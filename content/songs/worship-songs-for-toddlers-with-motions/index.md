### Devotional Thought
Just as God made birds to sing and flowers to dance in the wind, He made our bodies to move and praise Him! When we worship with our whole selves – our voices, hands, and feet – we're showing God how much we love Him. Jesus welcomes children's praise and delights in their joyful expressions of worship.

Prayer: "Dear Jesus, thank you for making us able to sing and dance for you. Help us worship you with happy hearts. Amen."
