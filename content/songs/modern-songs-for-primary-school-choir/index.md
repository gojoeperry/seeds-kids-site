## Worship Ideas

3. "This Little Light of Mine" (modern arrangement) - Give each child an electric tea light to raise during the chorus while singing about sharing God's love

### Devotional Thought
Just as each instrument in an orchestra has its unique sound, God has given each of us a special voice to praise Him. When we sing together in choir, we're like different colored crayons creating a beautiful picture of worship. Jesus loves hearing our voices joined together in praise, no matter if we're singing loud or soft, high or low.

Dear God, thank you for giving us voices to sing your praise. Help us to worship you with joy and love. Amen.

These songs are ideally suited for children ages 5-11 in primary school choirs. The lyrics and melodies are specifically chosen to be age-appropriate while maintaining spiritual depth that grows with the children.

Start with simple echo patterns, teaching one line at a time. Use hand motions and visual aids to help children remember lyrics. Practice the chorus first since it's usually repetitive and catches on quickly. Make learning fun by incorporating games and movement.
