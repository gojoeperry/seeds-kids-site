# Kids Worship Music CDs: Growing Young Hearts Through Song

### Introduction
Introducing your children to worship through a kids worship music CD can be one of the most powerful ways to nurture their spiritual growth. These specially crafted collections combine fun, age-appropriate lyrics with biblical truths that stick in young minds long after the music stops. When children engage with worship music designed just for them, they develop a natural connection to God that can last a lifetime. A quality kids worship music CD provides the perfect soundtrack for family devotions, Sunday School classes, or everyday moments in the car. The catchy tunes and meaningful messages help plant seeds of faith while creating joyful memories. Plus, children who learn to worship early often develop a stronger foundation in their faith journey.

### Scripture
"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise." - Psalm 98:4

"Let everything that has breath praise the Lord. Praise the Lord!" - Psalm 150:6

## Worship Ideas
1. "Jesus Loves Me" Dance Party: Play this classic from your kids worship music CD and add simple motions - jumping on "loves," hugging yourself on "me," and making a cross with arms on "Jesus."

2. "Bible Hero Freeze Dance": Choose upbeat worship songs and have kids act out biblical characters when the music stops (David playing his harp, Moses parting the sea, Daniel praying).

3. "Echo Praise": Select songs with simple choruses where children can echo the worship leader, creating an interactive praise experience.

### Devotional Thought
Just as birds sing their beautiful songs each morning, God gave us voices to sing His praises. When we worship, we're telling God how much we love Him, just like when you tell your parents you love them. Every time you sing along with your worship CD, you're making God smile!

Prayer: "Dear Jesus, thank you for giving us music to praise you. Help us to sing with joy and remember how much you love us. Amen."
