Just as our bodies can move and dance, our hearts can also move closer to Jesus.

Every jump, clap, and movement can be an expression of praise to our amazing God.

Prayer: "Dear Jesus, thank you for giving us music and movement to praise you. Help us use our whole bodies to show you how much we love you. Amen."
