   - "Wave hands for "all the children of the world"
   - "Point up for "Jesus"
   - "Cross arms over heart for "loves"

2. "This Little Light of Mine" with actions:
   - "Hold up index finger as "light"
   - "Hide light under other hand for "hide it under a bushel"
   - "Make wind-blowing motion for "won't let Satan blow it out"

3. Create a simple praise parade with ribbons and instruments

### Devotional Thought
Just as Jesus welcomed children with open arms, He welcomes our worship today. Every voice matters to God, especially the pure, honest praise of children. When we sing to God, we're telling Him how much we love Him and thank Him for His care. He delights in our songs, no matter how simple they may be.

Prayer: "Dear Jesus, thank you for loving children and listening to our songs. Help us to praise you with joy in our hearts. Amen."
