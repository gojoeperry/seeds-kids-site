# Jesus Loves Me

# Teaching Kids "Jesus Loves Me"

### Introduction
The simple yet profound truth that "Jesus loves me" forms the foundation of a child's spiritual journey. This cornerstone message helps children develop a secure relationship with God from their earliest years. When kids truly understand that Jesus loves them personally and unconditionally, they build confidence in their faith that can last a lifetime. Teaching children that "Jesus loves me" isn't just about words – it's about helping them experience and embrace God's endless love in ways they can understand and feel. As parents and teachers, we have the precious opportunity to plant these seeds of faith, showing our little ones that Jesus's love is real, constant, and meant specially for them. This fundamental truth becomes their anchor through life's ups and downs.

### Scripture
"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life." - John 3:16

"See what great love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God!" - 1 John 3:1

## Worship Ideas
1. Create a "Jesus Loves Me" hand motion song: Have children cross their arms over their chest for "Jesus," point to themselves for "loves," and hug themselves for "me."

2. Make a heart-shaped craft while singing the classic "Jesus Loves Me" hymn. Use construction paper, stickers, or finger paint to decorate hearts representing God's love.

3. Play "Pass the Love": Sit in a circle and pass a heart-shaped object, sharing one way Jesus shows His love when the music stops.

### Devotional Thought
Just like parents love their children no matter what, Jesus's love for us never changes. Even when we make mistakes or feel sad, Jesus loves us completely. He knows everything about us – our favorite colors, our biggest dreams, and even what makes us scared – and He loves us perfectly through it all.

Dear Jesus, thank you for loving me so much. Help me remember your love is always with me, no matter what happens. Amen.
