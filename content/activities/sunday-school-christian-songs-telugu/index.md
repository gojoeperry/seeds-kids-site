### Scripture
"Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom, singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, with thankfulness in your hearts to God." - Colossians 3:16

"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise." - Psalm 98:4

## Worship Ideas
1. "Yesu Nannu Premistadu" (Jesus Loves Me): Add simple hand motions showing love and pointing to heaven. Children can sway while singing the chorus.

2. "Devuni Studinchandi" (Praise the Lord): Create a simple dance routine where children can clap, jump, and turn in circles during the chorus. Use tambourines or bells for added engagement.

3. "Chinna Chinna Paapala" (Little Children): Form a circle and have children take turns leading actions in the center while others follow along.

Just as birds sing their beautiful songs each morning to praise God, we too can lift our voices in worship. When we sing Telugu Christian songs, we're telling Jesus how much we love Him in our own special way. He loves to hear children's voices raised in praise!

Prayer: "Dear Jesus, thank you for giving us songs to sing about your love. Help us to worship you with joy in our hearts. Amen."
