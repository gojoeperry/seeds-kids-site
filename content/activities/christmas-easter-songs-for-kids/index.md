# Christmas Easter Songs for Kids: Celebrating Jesus All Year Long

### Introduction
Teaching children about Jesus through Christmas Easter songs for kids creates lasting spiritual foundations that shape their faith journey. These special songs help young hearts understand the complete story of Jesus - from His humble birth in Bethlehem to His resurrection victory. When children learn Christmas Easter songs for kids, they begin to grasp how these two incredible celebrations are connected through God's perfect plan. The familiar melodies and simple lyrics make biblical truths accessible and memorable for little ones, while the joyful tunes create positive associations with worship. By incorporating these songs into both holiday seasons, parents and teachers can help children develop a year-round appreciation for Jesus's life, death, and resurrection.

### Scripture
"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life." - John 3:16

"Jesus said, 'Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.'" - Matthew 19:14

### Devotional Thought
Jesus came as a tiny baby because He loves us so much. He grew up and showed us God's love, then died on the cross and rose again to save us. When we sing about both Christmas and Easter, we remember that Jesus's whole life was part of God's amazing plan for us.

Dear Jesus, thank you for coming as a baby and for dying for our sins. Help us remember your love when we sing. Amen.
