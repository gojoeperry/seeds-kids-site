# What Is The Most Popular Christmas Song For Kids?

# What Is the Most Popular Christmas Song for Kids?
### Introduction
When asking "what is the most popular Christmas song for kids?" many would point to "Jingle Bells" or "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer." However, for Christian families and children's ministry leaders wondering what is the most popular Christmas song for kids in worship settings, "Away in a Manger" consistently ranks at the top. This beloved carol combines simple lyrics, a gentle melody, and the true story of Jesus's birth in a way that deeply resonates with young hearts. Teaching children meaningful Christmas songs helps them understand the real meaning of the season while creating lasting memories of worship. These songs become treasured tools for passing down our faith and helping children express their love for Jesus during the holiday season.

### Scripture
"Glory to God in the highest heaven, and on earth peace to those on whom his favor rests." - Luke 2:14

"Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these." - Matthew 19:14

## Worship Ideas
- "Create a "Christmas Carol Orchestra" using simple instruments like bells, tambourines, and shakers while singing "Away in a Manger"
- "Act out the nativity scene while singing, with children taking turns being different characters"
- "Learn simple hand motions to accompany each verse, helping children remember the words and engage physically with worship"
- "Make a birthday cake for Jesus and sing Christmas worship songs while celebrating His birth"

### Devotional Thought
Just as the shepherds and angels celebrated Jesus's birth with songs of praise, we too can worship Him through our Christmas carols. When we sing about baby Jesus lying in the manger, we remember that God loved us so much He sent His Son to earth as a tiny baby. This reminds us that Jesus understands what it's like to be young, just like you!

Prayer: "Dear Jesus, thank you for coming as a baby and for loving children like me. Help me worship you with joy as I sing Christmas songs. Amen."

### FAQs

Q: How can I make Christmas songs more meaningful for my kids?
A: Connect songs to Bible stories, use pictures or nativity scenes while singing, and discuss the lyrics' meanings. Make it interactive with motions or instruments, and share why these songs are special to your own faith.
