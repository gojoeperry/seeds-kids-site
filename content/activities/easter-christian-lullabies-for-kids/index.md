### Scripture
"Jesus said, 'Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.'" - Matthew 19:14

"The Lord your God is with you, He will quiet you with His love." - Zephaniah 3:17

## Worship Ideas
1. "Jesus Loves Me Easter Version" - Sing this familiar tune with Easter-themed lyrics while rocking or swaying together
2. "The Easter Garden" - A gentle song about spring flowers and new life, with simple hand motions showing flowers growing
3. "Sleeping in God's Love" - A peaceful lullaby incorporating Easter themes of hope and joy, perfect for bedtime snuggles

Create a cozy worship atmosphere by dimming lights and using soft instrumental music as background. Add gentle motions like butterfly wings or cross shapes with hands.

### Devotional Thought
Just as Jesus rose to new life on Easter morning, He gives us new life too. Every time we go to sleep and wake up, we can remember how much Jesus loves us. He watches over us while we sleep and celebrates with us when we wake up. God's love is gentle and peaceful, just like a beautiful lullaby.

Dear Jesus, thank you for loving us so much. Help us rest peacefully in your care tonight. Amen.
