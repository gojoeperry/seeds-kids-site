- "Form small groups to take turns leading different song sections, encouraging leadership and participation"
- "Add percussion instruments like tambourines or shakers to enhance the worship experience"

### Devotional Thought

When we worship God with all our hearts, we help others see how amazing He is. Every time we sing, dance, and celebrate God's goodness, we're showing the world His greatness.

Dear God, help us magnify Your love today through our songs and actions. Thank You for letting us be part of Your amazing plan. Amen.
