# Christmas Christian Songs with Motions for Kids

### Introduction
Teaching children Christmas Christian songs with motions is a delightful way to celebrate the birth of Jesus while engaging young hearts and minds. When kids combine music with movement, they not only have fun but also retain biblical truths more effectively. Christmas Christian songs with motions help children express their joy and worship through their whole bodies, making the experience more meaningful and memorable. These interactive worship songs create lasting spiritual connections and help build a strong foundation of faith during the holiday season. As parents and teachers, introducing these songs allows us to pass down both the Christmas story and essential Christian values in an age-appropriate, engaging way that children naturally love and respond to.

### Scripture
"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise." - Psalm 98:4

"Let them praise his name with dancing and make music to him with timbrel and harp." - Psalm 149:3

- "Point up for "Lord" and "King"

2. "Away in a Manger" with Cradle Rock

### Devotional Thought
Just as the angels sang to announce Jesus's birth, we too can use our voices and bodies to praise Him. When we sing and move in worship, we're showing God our love with our whole selves. Jesus came as a tiny baby to bring joy to the world, and we can share that joy through our songs and movements.

Prayer: "Dear Jesus, thank you for coming to earth as a baby. Help us to share your love through our songs and actions. Amen."
