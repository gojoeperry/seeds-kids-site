# Easter Songs For Kids To Sing At Church

# Easter Songs for Kids to Sing at Church
### Introduction
Teaching easter songs for kids to sing at church is a wonderful way to help children understand and celebrate the joy of Jesus' resurrection. These special songs create lasting memories while building a strong foundation of faith during the Easter season. When children learn and perform easter songs for kids to sing at church, they not only participate in worship but also internalize important biblical truths in an age-appropriate way. The combination of melody, movement, and meaningful lyrics helps young hearts connect with the Easter story, making it more memorable and impactful. As parents and teachers, introducing these songs during the Easter season provides an opportunity to share God's love and the miracle of resurrection in ways that children naturally embrace and enjoy.

### Scripture
"Jesus said, 'Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.'" - Matthew 19:14

"This is the day that the Lord has made; let us rejoice and be glad in it." - Psalm 118:24

## Worship Ideas
1. "Jesus Is Alive" - A simple action song where children hop on one foot when singing "alive" and spread their arms wide for "love."

2. "Easter Morning" - Use egg shakers or bells while singing about the empty tomb, incorporating movements like rolling away the stone.

3. "He Is Risen Indeed" - Create a call-and-response song where one group sings "He is risen" and the other responds "He is risen indeed!" with jumping and celebration.

### Devotional Thought
Jesus loves children so much, and He wants them to celebrate His resurrection with joy and excitement. Just as the women at the tomb were overjoyed to find Jesus alive, we can share that same happiness through our songs and worship. When we sing about Easter, we're telling the amazing story of God's love and how Jesus gave us new life.

Prayer: Dear Jesus, thank you for loving us so much. Help us sing with joy as we celebrate Your resurrection. Amen.
