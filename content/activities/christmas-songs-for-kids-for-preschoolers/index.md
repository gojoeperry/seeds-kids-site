# Christmas Songs For Kids For Preschoolers

# Christmas Songs for Kids for Preschoolers: A Joyful Guide to Holiday Worship

### Introduction
Teaching christmas songs for kids for preschoolers is one of the most delightful ways to share the true meaning of Christmas with little ones. These special songs help plant seeds of faith while creating precious memories during the holiday season. When preschoolers learn christmas songs for kids, they begin to understand Jesus' birth story in an age-appropriate, engaging way that speaks to their hearts. Through simple melodies and movements, even the youngest children can participate in worship and celebration of our Savior's birth. These songs become treasured tools for both parents and teachers to nurture spiritual growth during this magical time of year.

### Scripture
"Glory to God in the highest heaven, and on earth peace to those on whom his favor rests." - Luke 2:14

"Jesus said, 'Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.'" - Matthew 19:14

## Worship Ideas
1. "Away in a Manger" with Cradle-Rocking Motions
- "Have children pretend to rock baby Jesus while singing"
- "Add soft "shhh" sounds between verses"

2. "Joy to the World" with Dancing Ribbons
- "Give each child a red or green ribbon to wave"
- "Jump up on "Joy" and twirl ribbons in circles"

3. "Little Drummer Boy"
- "Use toy drums or pat legs for percussion"
- "March in place while making "pa rum pum pum pum" sounds"

### Devotional Thought
Jesus came as a tiny baby, just like all of us once were. When we sing Christmas songs, we're telling the story of God's amazing love in sending His Son. Even the angels sang when Jesus was born! God loves to hear children's voices lifted in praise, just like He loved hearing the angels sing on that first Christmas night.

Dear God, thank you for baby Jesus and for giving us songs to celebrate His birth. Help us share Your love through our singing. Amen.
