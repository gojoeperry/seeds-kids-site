### FAQs

### What age group is best for VBS songs?

Start by breaking down the song into small parts, teaching one section at a time. Use lots of hand motions, keep the energy high, and repeat often. Remember to model enthusiasm and make it fun! Consider using visual aids or props to help children connect with the lyrics.
