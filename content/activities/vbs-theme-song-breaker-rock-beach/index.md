### Devotional Thought
Just like the ocean is full of endless waves, God's love for us never runs dry. When we're at the beach, we can see, hear, and feel the power of the waves - that's how God's love surrounds us too! He created the mighty ocean and every creature in it, and He created you with the same amazing care and attention.

Dear God, thank you for loving us as big as the ocean. Help us remember your love when we sing and dance to worship you. Amen.
