Jesus came as a tiny baby to show us how much God loves us. Just like parents prepare special gifts for Christmas, God prepared the most amazing gift by sending Jesus. When we sing Christmas songs, we're like the angels who celebrated that first Christmas night! We can thank God for His wonderful gift and share His love with others through our joyful singing.

Dear Jesus, thank you for coming as a baby and for loving us so much. Help us remember the true meaning of Christmas as we sing songs about your birth. Amen.
