# Easter VBS Theme Songs for Kids' Worship

### Introduction
Easter VBS theme songs provide a powerful way to help children understand and celebrate the resurrection of Jesus through music and movement. These engaging melodies and lyrics create lasting memories while teaching biblical truths about God's amazing love. When kids learn Easter VBS theme songs, they're not just memorizing words – they're hiding God's Word in their hearts through catchy tunes and meaningful movements. The combination of music, scripture, and interactive worship helps bring the Easter story to life for young believers. Whether you're planning a Vacation Bible School program or simply want to incorporate more Easter-focused worship into your children's ministry, these theme songs can transform ordinary moments into opportunities for spiritual growth and joyful praise.

### Scripture
"Jesus said, 'I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live, even though they die.'" - John 11:25

"He is not here; he has risen, just as he said." - Matthew 28:6

## Worship Ideas
1. "Alive, Alive" - Have children crouch down low during "dead, dead, dead" and jump up with arms raised for "alive, alive!" Creates memorable physical connection to resurrection.

2. "Jesus Is Alive Today" - Form a circle and have kids march while singing chorus, then act out rolling the stone away during verses.

3. "He's Got the Whole World" - Add Easter verses about the empty tomb and Jesus' victory. Let kids suggest new verses and motions.

### Devotional Thought
Just like a butterfly emerges from its cocoon, Jesus emerged from the tomb to give us new life. When we sing Easter songs, we're celebrating this amazing gift of love and transformation. God wants us to share this joy with others through our voices and actions.

Prayer: Dear Jesus, thank you for giving us songs to celebrate your resurrection. Help us remember that Easter isn't just about one day – it's about the new life you give us every day. Amen.
