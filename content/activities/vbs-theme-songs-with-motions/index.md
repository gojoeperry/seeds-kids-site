# VBS Theme Songs with Motions: Making Worship Fun for Kids

### Introduction
VBS theme songs with motions are more than just fun activities – they're powerful tools for helping children connect with God through music and movement. When kids combine memorable melodies with physical actions, they engage multiple senses, making the worship experience more meaningful and lasting. Popular VBS theme songs with motions help children express their faith joyfully while building confidence in their relationship with Jesus. These songs create an atmosphere where kids can be themselves while learning biblical truths in an age-appropriate way. Whether used during summer VBS programs or incorporated into regular children's ministry activities, action songs help young hearts and minds retain spiritual messages through engaging, interactive worship.

### Scripture
"Let them praise his name with dancing and make music to him with timbrel and harp." - Psalm 149:3

"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise." - Psalm 98:4

## Worship Ideas
1. "Every Move I Make" - Have children jump on "move," wave arms for "waves of mercy," and spin for "in Your presence." This classic VBS song teaches God's constant presence.

2. "This Little Light of Mine" - Kids hold up pointer fingers as "lights," hide them behind backs for "hide it under a bushel," and make whooshing motions for "won't let Satan blow it out."

3. "Jesus' Love is Bubbling Over" - Children start crouched down and slowly rise while making bubbling motions with their hands, ending with arms raised high.

### Devotional Thought
Just as our bodies move and dance when we're happy, God loves to see us express our joy in worship. When we use VBS theme songs with motions, we're using our whole selves to praise Him – just like King David danced before the Lord! Remember, worship isn't about being perfect; it's about showing God our love with all our heart.

Prayer: "Dear Jesus, thank you for the gift of music and movement. Help us worship you with joy and freedom. Amen."
