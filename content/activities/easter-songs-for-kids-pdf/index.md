### Scripture
"Jesus said to her, 'I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live, even though they die.'" - John 11:25

"He is not here; he has risen, just as he said." - Matthew 28:6

## Worship Ideas
1. "He's Alive!" - Have children crouch down low and slowly rise up while singing, symbolizing Jesus rising from the tomb. Add hand motions reaching toward heaven.

2. "Easter Morning Praise Parade" - Create a joyful procession with rhythm instruments, waving palm branches (real or paper), while singing about Jesus's victory.

3. "God's Love Is Like a Butterfly" - Use butterfly motions to demonstrate transformation and new life in Christ, perfect for Easter morning celebrations.

### Devotional Thought
Just as a butterfly emerges from its cocoon, Jesus emerged from the tomb to give us new life. Easter reminds us that God's love is stronger than anything - even death! When we feel scared or sad, we can remember that Jesus is alive and with us always. 

Prayer: "Dear Jesus, thank you for loving us so much that you died and rose again. Help us share your love with others. Amen."
