# Easter Action Songs For Kids

# Easter Action Songs for Kids: Celebrating Jesus with Music and Movement

### Introduction
Easter action songs for kids provide an engaging and memorable way for children to celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ. These interactive worship experiences combine music, movement, and biblical truth to help young hearts connect with the Easter story. By incorporating easter action songs for kids into your family devotions or children's ministry, you create opportunities for active learning and joyful praise. Children naturally love to move and express themselves through music, making action songs the perfect tool for teaching Easter's powerful message. When kids use their whole bodies to worship, the truths about Jesus' love and sacrifice become deeply rooted in their hearts and minds. Easter action songs for kids also help build community as children worship together, creating lasting memories of faith celebrations.

### Scripture
"Jesus said, 'Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.'" - Matthew 19:14

"This is the day that the Lord has made; let us rejoice and be glad in it." - Psalm 118:24

## Worship Ideas
1. "Jesus Is Alive" - Children march in place while singing the chorus, then jump with arms raised when singing "alive." During verses, act out rolling the stone away and spreading the good news.

2. "Easter Morning Happy Day" - Kids crouch down pretending to be the tomb, then burst up with joy when singing about resurrection. Add hand motions for cross shapes and heart symbols.

3. "He Is Risen Indeed" - Create a simple call-and-response song where one group sings "He is risen" and others respond "He is risen indeed" with corresponding movements.

### Devotional Thought
Just as Jesus rose from the dead, bringing new life and hope to the world, we can celebrate with our whole bodies and hearts. When we sing and move in worship, we're showing God how happy we are about His amazing love. Every jump, clap, and motion reminds us that Easter is the happiest celebration because Jesus is alive!

Dear Jesus, thank you for giving us songs to sing and ways to move as we worship you. Help us remember the joy of Easter every time we sing and dance for you. Amen.
