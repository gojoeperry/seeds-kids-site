### Devotional Thought
Just as the angels danced and sang to celebrate Jesus's birth, we too can praise God with our whole bodies. When we dance and sing for Jesus, we're showing Him how happy we are that He came to earth as our Savior. Every jump, twirl, and motion can be a gift of praise to God.

Prayer: Dear Jesus, thank you for giving us music and dance to praise you. Help us share your joy with others through our songs and movements. Amen.
