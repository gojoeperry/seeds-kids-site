Jesus came as a tiny baby to show us God's amazing love. Just like the shepherds and wise men brought their gifts to Jesus, we can bring Him our gift of worship through songs. When we sing about Jesus' birth, we're telling the wonderful story of God's greatest gift to us. Every time we sing these special songs, we're showing Jesus how much we love Him.

Dear Jesus, thank you for coming as a baby on Christmas. Help us to sing with joy and share your love with others. Amen.
