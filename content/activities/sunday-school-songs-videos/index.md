### Devotional Thought
Just as Jesus welcomed children to come to Him, He delights in hearing their voices raised in song. When we sing praises to God, we're showing Him our love and thankfulness for all He's done. Every voice matters to God, whether it's perfectly in tune or just making a joyful noise!

Prayer: "Dear Jesus, thank you for giving us songs to sing about your love. Help us to praise you with happy hearts. Amen."
