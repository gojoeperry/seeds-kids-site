### Devotional Thought
Jesus came as a tiny baby to show us how much God loves us. When we sing Christmas songs about His birth, we're telling the most amazing story ever told! Just like the angels sang to announce Jesus's birth, we can use our voices to praise Him and share His love with others. Think about how special it is that God chose to send His Son as a baby, just like you once were.

Prayer: "Dear Jesus, thank you for coming as a baby and for loving us so much. Help us to sing about you with joy in our hearts. Amen."
