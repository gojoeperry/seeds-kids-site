Start with "Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Prayer" - a fun adaptation of the classic children's song where kids touch each body part and end in a prayer position. Follow with "This Little Light of Mine," using finger motions to represent the light and adding whole-body movements when "letting it shine." Create a simple percussion band using rice shakers (plastic eggs filled with rice) for "Jesus Loves Me," allowing kids to keep rhythm while singing.
