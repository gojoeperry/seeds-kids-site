Jesus came as a tiny baby to show us God's amazing love. Just like the shepherds and wise men celebrated His birth with songs and praise, we can worship Him with our voices and hearts today. When we sing Christmas songs, we're telling the story of God's greatest gift to us.

Prayer: Dear Jesus, thank you for coming to earth as a baby. Help us remember the true meaning of Christmas as we sing songs of praise to you. Amen.
