# VBS Theme Songs Playlist: Fun Music for Kids' Worship

### Introduction
Creating the perfect VBS theme songs playlist is an essential part of making Vacation Bible School an unforgettable experience for children. These catchy, faith-filled songs do more than just entertain – they plant seeds of God's truth in young hearts that can last a lifetime. When kids learn about Jesus through music, the messages stick with them long after VBS ends. A well-crafted VBS theme songs playlist combines fun, biblical truth, and memorable melodies that children will sing throughout the year. Whether you're planning a VBS program or looking to bring that same energy into your home, these songs create opportunities for children to express their love for God through joyful worship.

### Scripture
"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise." - Psalm 98:4

"Let everything that has breath praise the Lord. Praise the Lord!" - Psalm 150:6

## Worship Ideas
1. "Jesus' Love is Like a Rainbow" - Have children make rainbow motions with their arms while singing about God's colorful creation and endless love.

2. "God's Army" - March in place, salute, and follow simple hand motions that reinforce being strong in the Lord.

3. "The B-I-B-L-E" - Create letter shapes with bodies while spelling out Bible, then hold hands in a circle while singing about God's Word being the book for me.

### Devotional Thought
Just like how our favorite songs make us happy and want to dance, praising God brings joy to our hearts and His! When we sing about Jesus, we're telling Him how much we love Him and thanking Him for all He's done. God loves to hear children's voices lifted in praise.

Dear God, thank you for giving us music to praise You. Help us remember these special songs and share Your love with others. Amen.
