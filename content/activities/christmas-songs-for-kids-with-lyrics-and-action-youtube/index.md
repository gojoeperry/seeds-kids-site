Jesus came as a baby to show us God's amazing love. When we sing Christmas songs, we're celebrating His birthday and telling others about His gift of salvation. Just like the angels sang to announce Jesus's birth, we can use our voices and actions to praise Him too. Every time we sing and move to worship songs, we're showing Jesus how much we love Him.

Dear Jesus, thank you for coming as a baby and for giving us music to praise you. Help us share your joy with others through our songs and actions. Amen.
