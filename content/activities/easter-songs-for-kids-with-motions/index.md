# Easter Songs For Kids With Motions

# Easter Songs for Kids with Motions: Fun Ways to Celebrate Jesus

### Introduction
Teaching easter songs for kids with motions is a wonderful way to help children experience the joy of Easter while learning about Jesus's resurrection. When children combine music with movement, they engage multiple senses, making the message more memorable and meaningful. Easter songs for kids with motions allow them to worship with their whole bodies, just as King David danced before the Lord. These interactive worship experiences create lasting memories and help build a strong foundation of faith. Whether you're a parent, Sunday school teacher, or children's ministry leader, incorporating motion songs into your Easter celebration can transform an ordinary lesson into an extraordinary moment of praise.

### Scripture
"Let them praise his name with dancing and make music to him with timbrel and harp." - Psalm 149:3

"This is the day that the Lord has made; let us rejoice and be glad in it." - Psalm 118:24

## Worship Ideas
1. "Jesus Is Alive" - Have children jump up with arms raised when singing "alive," crouch down for "tomb," and make walking motions for "walked away."

2. "Every Move I Make" - Children can march in place, clap hands, and spin around while singing about Jesus's love.

3. "He Is Risen" - Create simple hand motions: point up for "risen," make cross shapes with arms, and wave hands high for "Hallelujah."

### Devotional Thought
Just as our bodies move and dance with joy when we're happy, God wants us to express our love for Him with our whole selves. When Jesus rose from the dead, His friends were so excited they ran to tell others! We can show our excitement about Jesus through our songs and movements too. 

Prayer: Dear Jesus, thank you for giving us music and movement to praise you. Help us share your joy with others through our songs and actions. Amen.

### FAQs

**What age group is best for motion songs?**
Motion songs work well for children ages 2-10, but they're especially effective with preschool and early elementary children (ages 3-7). Younger children naturally love to move, and motion songs help them stay engaged while learning.

**How can I teach motion songs effectively to a group?**
Start by demonstrating the motions slowly while explaining them. Break down complex movements into simple steps. Practice the motions first without music, then add the song. Remember to be enthusiastic - your energy is contagious!

**Where can I find good Easter motion songs for kids?**
You can find excellent resources on Christian children's music channels on YouTube, websites like Seeds Family Worship or Go Fish Kids, and through your church's children's ministry curriculum. Many publishers also offer DVDs specifically designed for children's worship with motions.
