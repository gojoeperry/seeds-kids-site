# Easter Songs for Kids for Church: Celebrating Jesus with Joy

### Introduction
Teaching easter songs for kids for church is a wonderful way to help children understand and celebrate the profound meaning of Christ's resurrection. These special songs create lasting memories while planting seeds of faith in young hearts. When children learn easter songs for kids for church, they not only grasp biblical truths but also experience the joy of worship in an age-appropriate way.

### Scripture
"Jesus said, 'Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.'" - Matthew 19:14

"He is not here; he has risen, just as he said." - Matthew 28:6

## Worship Ideas
1. "Jesus Is Alive" - Have children jump up on "alive" and make cross shapes with their arms while singing
2. "Easter Morning" - Use simple hand motions to tell the resurrection story: rolling the stone (rolling arms), angels appearing (flapping wings), and Jesus rising (reaching up high)
3. "God's Love Is So Amazing" - Create a circle dance where children hold hands and move in rhythm, celebrating God's love shown through Easter

### Devotional Thought
Just as spring brings new flowers and baby animals, Easter reminds us that Jesus gives us new life. When Jesus rose from the dead, He showed us how much God loves us and that nothing is impossible with Him. Every time we sing Easter songs, we're telling this amazing story of God's love.

Dear Jesus, thank you for loving us so much. Help us remember the joy of Easter as we sing songs about You. Amen.
