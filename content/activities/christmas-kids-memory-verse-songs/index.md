# Christmas Kids Memory Verse Songs: Building Faith Through Holiday Music

### Introduction
Teaching children Bible verses through Christmas kids memory verse songs is one of the most effective and joyful ways to plant God's Word in young hearts during the holiday season. When scripture is set to familiar Christmas tunes, kids naturally absorb biblical truths while having fun. These Christmas kids memory verse songs create lasting memories that can shape a child's faith journey for years to come. Not only do they make scripture memorization easier, but they also help children understand the true meaning of Christmas through music. As parents and teachers, we have the wonderful opportunity to use these engaging songs to help our children hide God's Word in their hearts during this special time of year.

### Scripture
"For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace." - Isaiah 9:6

"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men." - Luke 2:14

## Worship Ideas
1. "Joy to the Word" Scripture Version
- "Sing "Joy to the World" but replace verses with Luke 2:14"
- "Add hand motions: raise hands for "Glory," point up for "highest," make peace signs"
- "Create a simple dance routine with jumping and spinning"

2. "Away in a Manger" Bible Verse Match
- "Write different Christmas verses on star cutouts"
- "Kids pick a star and sing the verse to the tune of "Away in a Manger"
- "Include simple instruments like bells or tambourines"

### Devotional Thought
Just as the angels sang to announce Jesus's birth, we can use our voices to share God's love through Christmas songs and Bible verses. When we memorize Scripture through music, we're filling our hearts with the same joy that filled Bethlehem on that first Christmas night. God gave us the gift of music to help us remember His promises and share His love with others.

Prayer: Dear Jesus, thank you for the gift of music and Your Word. Help us to sing joyfully and remember Your love this Christmas season. Amen.
