# Christian Christmas Songs With Motions

# Christian Christmas Songs with Motions for Kids

### Introduction
Teaching children Christian Christmas songs with motions is a wonderful way to help them celebrate the birth of Jesus while engaging their whole bodies in worship. When kids combine music, movement, and biblical truth, they create lasting memories and develop a deeper understanding of God's love. Christian Christmas songs with motions allow children to express their joy physically while learning important truths about the nativity story. These interactive worship experiences help young ones stay focused, make learning fun, and create meaningful connections with their faith. Whether you're a parent, Sunday school teacher, or children's ministry leader, incorporating motion-based Christmas songs into your holiday celebrations can spark enthusiasm and help kids grow spiritually during this special season.

"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise." - Psalm 98:4

"Let them praise his name with dancing and make music to him with timbrel and harp." - Psalm 149:3

1. "Joy to the World" with Star Motions

- "Make circular motions for "world"
- "Point to heaven when singing about the Lord"

2. "Away in a Manger" with Cradle Rock

### Devotional Thought
Just as the angels sang to announce Jesus's birth, we too can use our voices and bodies to praise Him. When we sing and move in worship, we're showing God how happy we are that He sent Jesus to be our Savior. Every motion we make can be a gift of praise to God.

Prayer: Dear Jesus, thank you for coming as a baby on Christmas. Help us to worship you with our whole hearts, voices, and bodies. Amen.
