# VBS Theme Songs for Toddlers: Making Worship Fun for Little Ones

### Introduction
Introducing vbs theme songs for toddlers is one of the most joyful ways to plant seeds of faith in young hearts. These simple, engaging melodies create lasting memories while teaching fundamental truths about God's love. When toddlers learn vbs theme songs, they're not just memorizing words – they're building a foundation of worship that can last a lifetime. The repetitive nature and cheerful tunes make these songs perfect for little ones who are just beginning to explore their faith. Parents and teachers often find that these special songs become treasured favorites, sung not just during Vacation Bible School but throughout the year at home, in the car, and during everyday moments.

### Scripture
"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth!" (Psalm 100:1)
"Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these." (Matthew 19:14)

## Worship Ideas
1. "Jesus Loves Me" with Sign Language
- "Teach simple hand motions for "Jesus," "loves," and "me"
- "Add gentle swaying or jumping for active engagement"

2. "This Little Light of Mine"
- "Give each child a battery-operated tea light"
- "Practice raising lights high and hiding them under hands"

3. "God Made Me"
- "Touch head, shoulders, knees during verses"
- "Spin in circles for "God made everything!"

### Devotional Thought
God gave us voices to sing His praises and bodies to dance with joy. When we sing songs about Jesus, we're telling Him how much we love Him, just like giving a big hug to someone special. Every time we sing these fun songs, we're reminding ourselves that God loves us and wants us to be happy.

Dear Jesus, thank you for music and singing. Help us use our voices to show our love for you. Amen.
