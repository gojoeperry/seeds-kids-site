With its top in the heavens and let us make a name for ourselves  
Lest we be dispersed over the face of the whole earth  
Over the face of the whole earth”

So that they may not understand one another’s speech.”  
So the Lord dispersed them from there over the face of all the earth  
And they left off… building the city  

And they called it Babel, they built a tower  
They told themselves, this is our finest hour  
And they called it Babel, but God burst their bubble  
And they left that city unfinished rubble  
And they called it Babel
